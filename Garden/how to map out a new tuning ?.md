# How to map out a new tuning ?
Depending on how you chose a particular tuning you might already have some pointers about easy keys to play in, chord shapes, scale degrees etc.
A good first step when mapping out a new tuning is to find the particular scale you want to play in and find that scale on all your stings starting with the lowest. Sing an ascending scale and find those notes on each string. 

Once you have this under your fingers the next step would be to find a few easy shapes for triads in this key. If your open strings spell the first chord of the key you want to play in, an easy shortcut is that your IV chord will always be on fret 5 and your V chord on fret 7. 

Find a major triad shape with the root on the 6th string and move it up and down the neck diatonically adjusting the 3rds when needed. You can usually find a triad shape involving strings 6, 5, 4 and or 3. Feel free to remove the fifth and double the root or third, it will be easier and sometimes sound better. 

Try to play those triads while adding the top open strings, this will create lovely interactions between fretted and open strings often giving you extensions of those triads. 

You can also move major or minor simple 3 fingers shapes up and down the neck non diatonically still incorporating open strings, this horizontal exploration will make you discover new voicings outside of the original key you intended. By the magic of harmony some of them will sound great and will allow you to explore sounds outside of a single key. Ask me about modal interchange if you want to know more about why this works. 

If you discovered a tuning thanks to an existing song you will already have plenty of material in this tuning, use some chord shapes or runs you learned covering the first tune when composing your own song. 

Another thing I encourage you to explore when encountering a new tuning would be the harmonics. Start with frets 12, 7 and 5. Pluck them, slap them, try to create melodies with only harmonics. 

In my opinion you shouldn't spend so much time studying every alternate tuning you use, you don't want to reach the same level of fluency you might have with standard. The point is not to relearn every chord shape and scale in a new tuning but rather to explore a new universe of sounds with your ears only.
