What does it mean for a piece of music to be in a specific key ?

It means it uses notes and [[chords]] from a specific family which shares the same [[the 12 semitones#They are divided between|accidentals]]. The music will revolve around a stable note and chord called the [[tonic]]. 

# circle of fifths
There are 12 possible arrangements of alterations giving you a total of 24 possible keys (12 Major and 12 [[relative minor]]) as featured on the circle of fifths.

You can observe that as we navigate clockwise on this circle we increase the number of sharps by one and increase the number of flats by one when going counterclockwise. 

This adding of sharps or flats serves the purpose of keeping the structure of the [[major scale]] intact from any starting note also called [[tonic]].

These sharps and flats are indicated at the beginning of the sheet and are called the [[key signature]].
