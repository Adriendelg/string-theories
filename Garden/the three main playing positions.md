# sitting
Irregardless of the leg you choose to put the guitar on, the same principles apply to your sitting position:
- sitting on your butt bones
- both feet on the ground
- with an aligned spine
## factors to consider
In order to find a comfortable sitting position, one has to think about the height of the chair and their footstool, the depth of the seat and its angle or the length of the strap
## guitar on left leg
mostly found in [[classical|classical guitar]] and sometimes in other [[acoustic]] guitar players, the left leg is generally on a [[footstool]] to give the neck of the guitar a more vertical orientation, [[guitar supports]] are also sometimes used to achieve the same effect
## guitar on the right leg
most common sitting position, the left leg is sometimes raised with a footstool or a [[strap]] is used to alter the position of the guitar
# [[standing]]
Using a [[strap]] and playing in a standing position. Be mindful of strap length, a low guitar might look cool to play rock music but is not so well suited to precise and intricate playing.
