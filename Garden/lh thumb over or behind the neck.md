This is dangerous territory. This subject always brings heated debates between guitar players from different background. I will give my opinion, informed by years of playing multiple genres of music and different instruments as well as hanging out with and learning from as many guitar players from varied backgrounds as possible. 

# they both work
It would be of bad faith to say that only one side of the argument has accomplished players. There are countless examples of amazing guitarists using one or the other. 

The question is not which is better but which is better at what ?

# but work for different things
[[Hendrix]] thumb-over-the-neck style works wonder for [[blues]] and rock playing. If you need strong bends, play with distortion at high volume, only deal in pentatonics and big grip chords on a narrow neck electric guitar then of course this approach will be better suited than a [[classical left hand position]]. Same thing goes for [[boom chick]] style fingerpicking where you might need your thumb to catch a cheeky alternate bass. 

On the other hand, good luck playing a [[Bach]] fugue with your thumb above the fretboard! We have to give credit where credit is due and classical guitar has by far the most challenging repertoire for the left hand of any style I have ever encountered. Classical guitarists have to play complex chord shapes, control the duration of notes independently, shred scales, arpeggios, play [[counterpoint]] all that on a nylon string with [[high action]] and low frets. If these guys have evolved a traditional left hand position over centuries, there's a good reason, it works best for what they do. It is no surprise to see a lot more modern jazz players and metal guitarists adopt a left hand technique that looks very classical. 

# what you should do
It all depends on the styles of music you want to explore more, look at how the best in the genre do it and emulate. 

If you wish to become an all rounder learn both. 

# how I do it
I have learned the two approaches and use them depending on the musical context I'm in. I can switch from one to the other on most guitars and will when needed. That switch is a big part of my personal approach to left hand, I am more interested in becoming a great all rounder and learning about guitar in general rather than sticking to one playing style.
