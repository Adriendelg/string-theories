> [!NOTE] a personal passion
> Modern fingerstyle is one of my specialties, I have developed a passion for this style of guitar since my teenage. Since then I have studied with the best players of the genre and worked at incorporating a lot of this style's elements into my playing. This is where my passion for [[alternate tunings]] come from.

Modern fingerstyle or percussive fingerstyle guitar is a new school of playing that started with [[Michael Hedges]] and his exploration of the instrument. This paved the way for new generations of players to experiment with the possibilities of the acoustic guitar, making use of [[extended techniques]] to change its identity into a legitimate solo instrument. 

Modern fingerstyle is not so much of a [[music genres|musical genre]] than an approach to the instrument. Players in this niche compose a wide range of different material but tend to have similarities in their technique. 

Some of the particularities of modern fingerstyle are:
- Solo virtuosic performances
- Playing with their [[fingers]]
- Important orchestration and timbre work
- Use of [[alternate tunings]]
- Use of [[percussions]] on the body of the guitar
- Use of [[amplification systems]] and [[effects]]
- Emulation of other instruments
- [[extended techniques]]
- Arrangements

It is a type of playing that draws influences from a very wide range of different guitar playing styles in the aim of making the [[acoustic|acoustic guitar]] sound bigger and more complex than it is.
