# nomenclature
We use p i m a to refer to [[right hand]] fingers, it comes from the Spanish and French tradition and is now adopted everywhere

![[Hand Fingering Labels.svg]]

# the basic rules of right hand fingerings 
- don't use the same finger twice in a row (except for the thumb)
	- this is important, alternating fingers when playing is key to a good execution
	- I call alternating i and m the "walking dude" with young students, the logic is that a one legged man can't run well, a two legged man can
	- try to play the same repeated note with only one finger as fast as you can, now try with two alternating fingers
- p mainly plays the lower three strings, it can still move to higher ones when needed
- we nearly never use the pinky except in [[hybrid picking]] or very rare scenarios
- when going from low strings to high strings always prefer using a motion from the thumb side to the pinky side of the hand and vice versa
