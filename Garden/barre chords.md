Doing a barre chord consists of using a [[left hand]] finger, most commonly the index to [[fretting|fret]] more than one string at once using more of the finger than the fingertip. There can be small barres of 2 or 3 strings up to full 6 strings barres. 

The first barre chord one usually encounters is a F Major chord that looks like this:

In this example the first fret should be barred with the entire length of the index finger pressing down all 6 strings. If you feel like this requires superhuman strength to sound good, I would advise to go through [[good habits for barre chords]].
