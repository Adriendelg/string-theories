As guitar players we are lucky to have an alternative to [[the staff|sheet music]]. Since the middle ages and the apparition of the [[lute]], musicians have used tablatures or tabs to simplify reading music and to express [[fingerings]] easily. 

# how to read tabs?
It is much simpler than sheet music.
1. there are 6 lines, one for each string organised from low to high
2. numbers on a line indicate what fret to play
3. the music is organised in [[bars]] just like with standard notation

That's it.

# variations
Sometimes tabs feature [[rhythm]] adding note stems, sometimes tabs and sheet are provided with tabs as a second line under the staff.

# why?
Tabs are useful to quickly show where a note is played, it reduces the work the interpreter has to do with choosing [[fingerings]]. Tabs are also necessary when transcribing a piece written in [[alternate tunings]], no one wants to read sheet music when their [[fretboard]] is all messed up by a different tuning.
