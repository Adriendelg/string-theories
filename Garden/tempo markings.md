Most pieces of music will have indication of how fast or slow they should be played. This information is written above [[the staff]] at the beginning of the piece. 

It can take multiple forms such as:
- â™©= 120, meaning [[quarter note|quarter notes]] are played at 120 Beats Per Minute, BPM
- some italian term like Moderato, or Allegro which refer to a range of tempo, we mostly find these in [[classical music]]

Here is a table of the different terms used:
