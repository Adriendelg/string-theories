Minor scales refer to scales where the third is a [[minor 3rd]] apart from the [[tonic]], scales where the [[tonic|tonic chord]] is a [[minor triad]].

There are multiple minor scales, therefore I will never use the term minor scale singular. I will use minor scales as a category of scales. 

# the most common minor scales
[[harmonic minor scale]]
[[natural minor scale]]
[[melodic minor scale]]

# all other minor scales
