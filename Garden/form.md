The form or structure of a piece is its skeleton, the general shape of the piece. It's the big picture analysis. 

Different musical [[music genres|genres]] have used different forms. From [[renaissance]] dances to the classical [[sonata]] form, the [[12 bars blues]], or the [[song form]] up to modern pop music, a wide range of musical structures have emerged.

They can be as simple as alternating verses and chorus or as complex as a multi dimensional sonata form spanning an entire symphony. 

# what musical form is about
When we analyse the form of a piece of music, we divide it into large parts. 

The form is often composed of multiple shorter [[chord progressions]] and [[cadence|cadences]]. 

How we divide the whole piece into parts is not arbitrary. We use repetitions, obvious points of [[tension and release]] or clear change in character to differentiate parts. 

Most musical forms are organised in sections of 4, 8, 16 or another multiple of 4 [[bars]]. 

Drawing from my jazz education, I tend to name parts with capital letters. 

# a few examples of musical forms 
Have you ever wondered what prelude, fugue, sarabande, rondo or pavane means? They are all musical forms used in classical music each with their particularity. 

One of the most well known form is the [[12 bars blues]], it always has the same 12 bars structure revolving around the [[tonic]], [[sub dominant]] and [[dominant]]. Even more advanced and complex variations on the blues follow this basic structure. 

The way a song is organised in verses, choruses and bridge is also an example of musical form. 

# how to identify the form of a piece
The form is the first element to be noticed when analysing a new piece, whether on paper or by ear it is the easiest level to identify. Where do obvious repetitions occur? Where are phrases resolved in a final manner? Where are the cliff hangers? How long are the different sections? 

These are all great questions to ask in order to sketch the outline of a piece of music, they are the zoomed out look necessary before diving deeper into details.
