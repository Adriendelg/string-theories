Moving the hand to pluck a string is not only unnecessary, it costs a lot of energy, takes your hand away from the strings and creates a harsher tone. 

It is often accompanied by [[pulling the strings out of the guitar]] and a lot of tension in the wrist and forearm.

> The correct motion of the hand to pluck strings is the same as opening and closing your hand. The most natural movement for our anatomy. 

The [[right hand]] should hover above the strings in a relaxed position and attack be made by simply pulling the finger toward the palm in a making-a-fist motion.
