# what your body is made for
As hunter gatherers now living in the modern world we have lost track of what the purpose of our anatomy was in the first place. 

We evolved to walk, run, climb, swim, hunt, explore. We are not made to sit in an office all day, and we're not made to play the guitar either. Now with that in mind how can we make this activity friendlier to our body ?
