When harmonising the modified [[natural minor scale harmonisation in triads|natural minor]] now called the [[harmonic minor scale]] in triads we observe this series:
- i min
- ii dim
- III M
- iv min
- V M
- VI V
- vii dim

here they are in [[root position]]

these are the chords used when writing [[chord progressions]] in a minor [[tonality|key]]
it features a Major chord on the 5th [[scale degrees|degree]] thanks to the G# which creates the appropriate tension when resolving to the [[tonic]], executing a [[V - I]] [[cadence]]
