Tonal music is organised around a single note/chord called the [[tonic]] which acts as a point of stability and resolution while other notes of the scale have different levels of tension or pull in relation to this central note. They have different [[functions]].

it uses the notion of [[tonality]] to organise its [[chord progressions|harmonic progressions]] and [[melody|melodies]], it manages [[tension and release]] through the use of resolutions called [[cadence|cadences]] 

as opposed to [[modal music]] and [[atonal music]]
