Have you ever seen a guitar player's pinky sticking out straight as a stick pointing toward the sky? That's flag poling. 

Having any finger stick out greatly increases the distance between the fingertip and the next fret it will need to play. This is a lot of unnecessary motion as well as a sign of tension in the hand. 

When you leave your hand hanging by your side no finger sticks straight out, it should be the same when playing the guitar.
