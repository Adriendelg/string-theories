# as a concept
The fretboard is the interface we guitar players use to understand music, it is a two dimensional space with six strings and 20ish frets. It's organisation depends on the [[tunings|tuning]] used. 
# as a guitar part
The fretboard is a piece of hard wood on which the frets are installed. It is traditionally made of ebony, rosewood or maple. ^c4mwcr
# in standard

# fretboard rules in every tunings
- consecutive frets are consecutive [[the 12 semitones|semitones]]
- pitches are arranged from low to high 
- [[natural harmonics]] keep the same pattern
- there are always [[note repetition on the fretboard|note repetition]] between strings
- open strings repeat at the 12th fret

# what it means to know the fretboard
Knowing the note names on every fret of every string in your tuning of choice is of the highest importance. This is no small task when beginning but it is only the first step of a long learning journey.

[[how to learn the notes of the fretboard?]]

Knowing [[scales]], [[chords]] and [[arpeggios]] shapes is the next step.

True mastery of the fretboard is when any musical element you desire is accessible anywhere on the fretboard.

# fretboard geometry
As the fretboard can be thought as a two dimensional matrix, it can be navigated along two axis.

For example, an ascending F [[major scale]] could be performed horizontally going up in pitch on the 6th string only, it could be performed vertically [[in position]] and ascend in pitch by changing strings and not moving the hand up the fretboard or diagonally mixing the two approaches. 

How one chooses to execute a scale or melody is a matter of choice. Contrary to the keyboard which is one dimensional, there are always multiple choices of [[fingerings]] for any musical element on the guitar.
