# history
standard tuning seems to have long historical roots, it originated with the 6 string guitar around the end of the 18th century and was popularized by composers and educators of the time such as [[Sor]] or [[Aguado]]

it most likely comes from variations around the [[lute]] tuning and 5 string baroque
guitar tuning

# why
it seems particularly well suited for [[tonal music]], offers easy melodic and harmonic playing with a good range, has easy [[open chords]]

# most friendly keys to play in
due to the presence of an open E and B, standard tuning without a [[capo]] is best suited for keys on the right side, the sharp side of the [[tonality#circle of fifths|circle of fifths]]
