# Why use alternate tunings ?
Why not ? Would be the best answer. As guitar players we have this opportunity to alter the layout and the tone of our instrument, it would be a shame not to !

## Allows for a wider range
The range of a guitar in [[standard tuning]] spans approximately 3,5 octaves, up to 4 on some instruments. 

Some open tunings allow for more than 4 octaves by dropping the bass to a low A or B for example. 

Having a wider range can contribute to making the guitar sound much bigger than it really is. By having a low tuned sixth string you can emulate some parts that would be played by a bass and emulate the sound of a complete band. 

I generally don't recommend tuning your top strings higher than a half or whole step away from standard as they are the most fragile and can break easily. 

## Makes some chord shapes/keys easier
Using alternate tunings will change the layout of the [[fretboard]], they can make [[chord voicings]] that would be very hard or impossible to play in [[standard tuning]] not only possible but easy on the left hand. They also can be an advantage to play in keys that would be unpractical in standard tuning. Want to play in Eb and use nice open strings voicings ? Find a tuning revolving around Eb. 

## Changes the harmonics
If you are a player that likes to use [[natural harmonics]] a lot in their compositions, using open tunings can open up new possibilities. Don't forget that you will find the octave, fifth, fourth, Major third of your open strings as your primary harmonics. 

## Easier tapping
To make playing two handed [[tapping]] easier, we have to make chord shapes as easy to play as possible. Most tapping tunes feature a fifth between the two lower strings allowing easy [[power chords]] to be tapped with one finger only. [[suspended modal tunings]] are well suited to tapping as they have a lot of octaves, fifths and fourths between the strings. 

## Changes the overall tone of the instrument
By changing the tuning of certain strings you inherently change the [[harmonics]] it will produce. This will change the way your guitar sounds in a massive way. Higher or lower tension will also change how a string feels and impact its intonation. 

## Specific arrangement needs
Maybe in your [[composition]] or [[arrangement]] process you end up needing a specific low note or a particular voicing. Alternate tunings can allow you this freedom, rather than having to revoice an entire chord, why not just change a string's tuning ?

## Makes the instrument fresh again
Changing tuning will turn the guitar into half a new instrument, your left hand will have lost its bearings. You will discover a world of new tones and musical opportunities you didn't know existed. If you grow bored with your playing, change tuning for a time and explore. 

## Makes you rely on your ear more than your brain
Most guitar players make the mistake of learning the fretboard in a visual and kinesthetic ([[muscle memory]]) way only. This leads to the repetition of the same patterns over and over and difficulties singing what they intend to play and can hinder improvisation and composition. Spending time in open tuning is amazing [[ear training]], since all the shapes will be different you will have to rely on your ears to navigate the instrument. Try and learn something from it and apply it to standard as well.
