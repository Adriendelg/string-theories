## The myth of the perfect posture
Whenever someone starts talking about posture a funny effect happens on the people around them, they all straighten up ! We all have had people telling us to sit straight or to stop slouching. The general reaction to this is to straighten our back in a rigid fashion for a while, then it starts feeling bad and we go back to our habitual way of holding ourself. 

Let me get this straight first, keeping an overly straight rigid back is not a healthy posture. 

We are not static, we are in constant movement. Even sitting on a chair and trying really hard to be still we still move our head and spine constantly balancing this entire structure. 

What's a healthy posture ? Your next posture.
