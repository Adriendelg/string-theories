Rest strokes are a different type of [[attack]] from [[free strokes]]. They are most common in [[classical guitar technique]] and [[flamenco]] but are also used in other genres both with the [[fingers]] and with a [[pick]]. Doing a rest stroke means playing through the string and stopping the motion on the next string. The finger or pick comes to rest on the next string, this type of attack produces a different usually louder and more powerful tone.
