The sound board is the top plank on an acoustic guitar, it's the most important part involved in creating a tone. You can think of it as the membrane of a speaker or the skin of a drum. It's what vibrates when we set [[strings in motion]].

This piece of wood is more than a simple plank, it is reinforced on the inside with smaller pieces forming a certain pattern, this is called the [[bracing]]. 

It can be made of any wood that is light, resonant and durable enough. It is typically either a kind of [[spruce]] or [[cedar]].
