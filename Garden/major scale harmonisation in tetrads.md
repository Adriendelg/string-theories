When harmonising the [[major scale]] in [[tetrads]] we obtain this series of seven chords.

```music-abc
X:1
T:Major Scale Harmonisation in Seventh Chords (Root Position)
M:4/4
L:1/2
K:C
[CEGB] [DFAc] | [EGBd] [FAce] | [GBdf] [Aceg] | [Bdfa]  |

> [!NOTE] same structure as [[major scale harmonisation in triads]]
> Note that as tetrads are built with triads plus an extra seventh we keep the same series of chords only this time they have one more high note.


We still use roman numerals to indicate [[scale degrees]].

![[major scale harmonisation in triads#their functions]]

# the [[V7 chord]]

#  [[harmonic minor scale harmonisation in tetrads|how about the relative minor?]]
