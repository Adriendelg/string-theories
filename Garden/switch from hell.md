This exercise is targeted at the independence between [[left hand]] fingers in pairs. It makes us work through three pairs of fingers: 1&2, 2&3 and 3&4 to develop our fine motor skills and stretches.

The easiest pair will be 1&2 as they are the fingers we use the most in everyday life. The hardest will be 3&4 since we rarely use them consciously on their own.

# how to do it
Start with fingers 1&2 and go through the exercise slowly keeping a good hand posture and solid [[fretting]] technique then repeat with fingers 2&3 and finally 3&4.

Always maintain a good position and tone, reduce the speed if necessary.

Keep track of the [[the beat|tempo]] in bpm and see if you can increase it overtime.
