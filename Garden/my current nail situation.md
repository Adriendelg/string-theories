I have had problem with my natural nails for as long as I've tried to play with them. For some reason â€“ mainly my own stubbornness â€“  I kept at it until it became a huge part of my playing causing me years of stupid nail anecdotes only classical guitarists can truly understand. 

After years of abuse with acrylic and other types of artificial nails my natural nails had become really thin, brittle and in general bad shape. Also most consumer grade material simply would not adhere to my damaged nails causing lifting of the artificial nail after only a few days. 

I tried spending a few months without any fake nails and hated the tone and feel of playing with flesh. My natural nails grew a little healthier but far from the strength needed for my daily practice. 

Refusing the cost and annoyance of regular visits to a professional salon, I went on the hunt for a DIY solution that would finally solve all my problems. I needed a technology that was long lasting and robust, could be built very thin and sound good on nylon and steel strings while not causing damage to my natural nails.
