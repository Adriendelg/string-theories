The footstool is an adjustable foot rest used under the left or right foot to change the angle of the neck and the general playing position. 

It comes from classical guitar, we have examples of images of guitar players using a footstool from centuries ago.

It is mostly used in classical guitar to achieve a more vertical angle of the neck.

While being a viable solution to achieve your desired posture it can also create postural problems. Raising a foot for a prolonged period of time can cause imbalance in the hips and some lower back pain. It might not be the most ergonomic solution. For a few years now we can find an alternative in [[guitar supports]] that allow you to keep both feet level on the ground and cause less overall strain on your hips and back. 

When playing with a footstool, its height is important, it can change your posture drastically. Classical guitar players show a wide range of variation in footstool height and general posture. 

Here is an interesting video about classical guitar posture comparing the playing position of different famous players with a professional osteopath: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgEmJ0kR86s&t=1244s
