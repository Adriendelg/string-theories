Playing a string, setting it [[strings in motion|in motion]], is the first thing we do when first picking up the guitar but rarely do we study the act in great detail. Observing the mechanics of our anatomy and how it interacts with the physical reality of the guitar can lead to a better understanding of [[technique]] and help fix [[common fingerstyle right hand mistakes|common mistakes]]. 

Plucking a string, the attack, can be decomposed in four steps:
# 1. movement
 following [[intent]], the finger or pick is set in motion toward the strings
this movement is always an arc described from an axis, think fingertip from big knuckle or pick from wrist

depending on the [[technique]] used the movement can be made from the arm, elbow, wrist, fingers or a combination

# 2. contact
the surface, either [[nails]], [[flesh]] or [[pick]] makes contact with the strings
this step is ideally silent, we don't want [[scratching]] 

# 3. energy stored 
just like a bow and arrow, at some point during the act of playing, a string is put under tension and stores energy

this step is not the one making the sound, only the preparation. just like a bow, the arrow hasn't left the string yet

strings should never be pulled up and away from the guitar but pushed toward the inside of the instrument

# 4. energy released
the string is released and now vibrates freely creating an audible pitch
