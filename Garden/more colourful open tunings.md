### More colourful open tunings
> [!info]+ Adding extensions 
> You can add extensions to a Major or minor open tuning. For it to strictly remain an open tuning those extensions should not include a note that is characteristic of a specific mode. Example a [[Sharp 11th]] turning a Major chord into a clear [[Lydian]] sound. 
> Think about 6ths, 4ths and 9ths as they colour the sound without spelling a specific mode.
