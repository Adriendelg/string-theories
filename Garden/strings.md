# [[changing strings]]
# [[classical guitar strings]
Made of nylon or carbon, they are softer on the fingers than steel. They also take longer to stay in tune after a string change. They are best suited to stay in one tuning and allow less options than steel when dealing with [[alternate tunings]].
# [[acoustic guitar strings]]
Made of different alloys and coming in a variety of [[string gauges]], they offer a brighter tone than nylon and allow for a wider variety of tunings.
# [[electric guitar strings]]
Made of different alloy than acoustic strings, they are optimised to transmit a strong signal to the [[pickup]]. They are usually lighter in gauges than acoustic guitar to allow for easier [[bends]] and because they don't need to set a [[sound board]] in motion.
# [[string gauges]]
Strings come in different thickness and tension.
# [[string coating]]
Some strings have a thin layer of coat to prevent oxydation and prolong their lifespan.
