just like the [[major scale]], we can harmonise the [[relative minor]] scale in triads


```music-abc
X:1
T:Natural Minor Scale Harmonisation in Triads
M:4/4
L:1/2
K:Am
[A,CE] [B,DF] | [CEG] [DFA] | [EGB] [FAc] | [GBd]  |
w: i iiÂ° III iv v VI VII i
```

since the natural minor scale uses all the same pitches as its relative Major, we can notice the same pattern of Major, minor and diminished [[triads]] only starting at a different point in the cycle (on the 6th [[scale degrees|degree]] of the Major scale)

we now get this new series of chords:
1. minor
2. diminished
3. Major
4. minor
5. minor
6. Major
7. Major

# the dominant problem
This is the perfect time to introduce the notion of [[functions]], in this current harmonisation the 5th chord of the scale, scale degree v can not play its [[dominant]] function, its role in the [[tonality|key]]. In order to perform its function it should be Major, not minor. 

> [!NOTE]- I still want to use this scale harmonisation
> [[aeolian scale harmonisation]]

The correction we need to make is to sharpen the note G.  With a G# in the scale our fifth chord is now Major and can perform his [[dominant|dominant function]].

# the correct scale for minor harmonisation
the relative minor scale as featured above changes name when we add this sharpened 7th note, it becomes the [[harmonic minor scale]], the scale upon which we build our chords when in minor keys.
