*there's more to it than just pressing down strings*

# how it works
the goal of the game is to press a string enough so that it makes contact with a fret, when that string is then [[strings in motion|set in motion]] only the part between the fret and the bridge will ring creating the appropriate note, we basically always shorten the length of a string

for this we use the four available fingers of the left hand, each have a number assigned, [[left hand fingerings]]

# the ideal 
there's only so much tension of the string and distance to the fret, there is a sweet spot of just enough weight to put on that string to press it without wasting energy

there is an anatomically most efficient way to use your hand, a natural arching of the fingers and organisation of the hand that allows for mechanical advantage without tension

there is no ceiling to fingers agility and movement control

*You want to be lazy and spend the minimal amount of energy to perform the musical needs of the moment.
