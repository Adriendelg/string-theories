Wether three on each side or six in line tuners work pretty much the same on every guitar. The string is going through a hole and locked around a barrel on which the string is wound when turning the tuner.

Different tuners have different ratios, meaning how much they multiply you turning the button and translate it to the barrel where the string is locked.
You want tuners that are smooth and durable. High quality tuners will help you when working in a wide variety of [[alternate tunings]].
