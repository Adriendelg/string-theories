String sets refer to a combination of strings. Due to [[note repetition on the fretboard]], chords can be played at different spots on the [[fretboard]]. We use string sets to mention what strings are in use for a given [[chord voicings|voicing]].

In [[standard tuning]], due to the presence of a [[Major 3rd]] between the 3rd and 2nd string we have to use different [[fingerings]] when the 2nd and 1st strings are involved. This mean learning additional shapes for the same material. (this is the reason behind [[P4 tuning]])

For example see [[major triads in standard tuning]].
