Most of music is about managing tension and release, creating expectations and either fulfilling them or not creating surprise. [[chord progressions]] and [[melody|melodies]] can create a strong pull toward a specific note or chord and play with our sense of anticipation. 

In [[tonal music]], the [[dominant]] plays the role of tension and the [[tonic]] the role of stability, moving from dominant to tonic provides a sense of relief. 

[[cadence|Cadences]] are great examples of tension and release. 

Tension and release is also present in [[modal music]] but uses other tools to achieve this effect.
