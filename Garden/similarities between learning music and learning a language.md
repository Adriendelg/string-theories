There are huge similarities between the way one learns a language and how one learns music. I won't go so far as to say that music is a language; it shares some characteristic elements but ultimately it can't translate complex explicit meaning. 
However, studying the parallels between the two can bring new understanding on best [[practice]] habits.

Both music and language have oral and written traditions, they can be spoken/played as well as written. 

We could organise aspects of learning both music and language thus:
- expression
	- oral
	- written
- understanding
	- oral 
	- written

Mastering a language means being able to both orally understand and speak it fluently as well as write and read it perfectly.

Being fluent in music is similar, one can become proficient at understanding written or 'spoken'/played music and at writing and playing it oneself. 

The ultimate 'music speaker' should be [[musical literacy|musically literate]], have strong [[analytical listening]] skills, be able to [[improvisation|improvise]], [[what it means to read music|read scores]], [[score analysis|analyse scores]], [[composition|write music]], understand the [[music theory|grammar of music]] etc.
# how we first learned our mother tongue
There was a time in everyone's life when they learned a language in the most natural fashion, when it was [[effortless]]. We all learned our mother tongue without much struggle. Going back and examining how a baby learns his first language can be enlightening for our music practice. 

[[Victor Wooten]], the great bass player has an amazing TED talk on the subject you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zvjW9arAZ0

He makes the point that we all learn from a playful immersion in language, we are surrounded by amazingly skilled speakers in the form of adults that speak around us constantly and invite us to participate. 

There is no required level to enter the conversation, adults speak with babbling children, they have conversation where there is no notion of mistake. The beginner is welcome into the group and encouraged to participate in a playful manner. 

Children imitate, adults respond and imitate back. New words and meanings are absorbed effortlessly, simply by participating in the conversation. 

This is the spirit we should emulate in our music learning. If you are a beginner, go play with advanced players, participate in the conversation in a light hearted playful manner. If you are advanced, welcome beginners in the conversation, play with them and teach them little words and phrases. Welcome mistakes and remember to have fun with the language, distort it, twist it, reinvent it.

# signs of mastery over a language
What are the signs we have mastered a new language? Bilinguals are an interesting study case, when do we switch from just being good at a new language to being fully fluent?

There are a few indicators of mastery, such as the ability to have complex, nuanced conversations on a wide number of subjects, being able to make jokes and puns, being able to full think and dream in the new language. 

This translates nicely to music learning.

Being able to entertain a complex nuanced conversation could be equated to being able to improvise a solo over complex [[chord progressions|chord changes]] and interacting with other musicians in real time. 

Making jokes and puns could mean being able to quote melodies outside of their context, twisting them in new and creative ways or fully using our instrument's potential in a playful manner.
