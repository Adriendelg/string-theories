Whenever you pick up a guitar to play anything, always make sure it is in tune and to a precise 440 hertz A.

This is important for different reasons, first we need the strings to be in tune relative to one another so that our playing sounds good. Second, always making sure you hear the correct precise pitches will help you with [[audiation]] and [[ear training]]. Having a constant reminder of what your open strings should sound like is a good way to foster good [[pitch memory]].
