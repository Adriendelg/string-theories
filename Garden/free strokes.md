Free strokes are the most frequent type of [[attack]] of the right hand, they can be performed with both the [[pick]] and [[fingers]], they consist of playing the string in one motion without going “through” the string and stopping on the next. The finger or pick stays free of the other strings after playing in contrast with [[rest strokes]].
