comes from [[classical]] guitar

playing with nails offers more volume, a clearer [[attack]] but comes with a lot more maintenance and care than playing with [[flesh ]]or a [[pick]]

to achieve a great tone you need a good [[nail shape]] and [[nail polishing]]

you can play with your [[natural nails]] if they are strong otherwise there are multiple [[artificial nails]] solutions each with their strengths and weaknesses
