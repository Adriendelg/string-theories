Chord voicing refers to the way the notes of a given [[chords|chord]] are organised. A chord formula gives us the recipe, the needed notes; its voicing gives us how those notes should be arranged. 

There are a variety of ways to voice a given chord, they can be broadly summed up in two categories: [[closed position]] and [[spread voicing]].
