The function of a chord means the role it plays in [[tonal music]] or at least in a [[cadence]]. There are three possible functions, every imaginable chord falls under one or two categories. 

They are:
- [[tonic]], which has a stable sound, these are the chords we resolve tension to
- [[sub dominant]], role of preparing coming tension, anticipation of a tension
- [[dominant]], unstable, tension chord it is asking for resolution and calls for a tonic

Harmony can be summed up as managing the [[tension and release]] of a chord progression.
