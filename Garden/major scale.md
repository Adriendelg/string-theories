The major scale is one of the basic building blocks of music, it is the tool used for most of [[tonal music]]. It's a specific arrangement of tones and [[the 12 semitones|semitones]] forming a series of 7 consecutive notes. We call the starting note of the scale the [[tonic]]. 
 
 It is modeled after the intervals of the C Major scale.

Note that the C Major scale only uses the white keys of the keyboard, no [[accidentals]] only natural notes. 

Now if we wanted to start the same series from a different pitch, let's say A, in order to respect the structure (WWHWWWH) we would need the alterations featured on the [[tonality#circle of fifths|circle of fifths]].

# relative minor
Every major [[tonality]] also has a [[relative minor]], it means a minor key that shares the same 7 notes. It is the same series of [[intervals]] only starting at a different point in the cycle. 

# chords of the major scale
we can construct chords by piling up notes from the scale, this is called harmonising, the most common are :

- [[major scale harmonisation in triads]]
- [[major scale harmonisation in tetrads]]
