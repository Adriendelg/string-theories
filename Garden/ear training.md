Ear training is a field of music [[practice]] dedicated to developing the aural understanding of musical structures. It is about making sense and recognising musical elements by listening to them.

# the best advice for any musician 
*Sing everything you play, all the time.

I mean all the time. Keep vocalising the pitches you play, sing [[melody|melodies]], [[chord voicings]], [[arpeggios]], [[lines]]. Sing everything. This will greatly help creating a strong link between what you hear and what it looks like on the guitar. 

# why it's even more important for guitar players
The guitar is a visual friendly instrument, the [[fretboard]] and its two dimensional matrix is easy to navigate with your eyes and muscle memory only. After enough practice, one could play an entire solo following complex changes without hearing a single note they play and nail it, navigating the music entirely by muscle memory and visual feedback. While this is impressive, it is far from ideal.

The best musical result is the one you can clearly hear in your mind. The best line over some chords is the one you can sing. The best tone you can produce is the one you can conceive of in your mind.

In contrast, a singer or a trumpet player can not play a single pitch they haven't first heard in their mind's ear, they have to really hear every note they want to play. 

This is what we are trying to achieve on guitar, a strong link between your internal hearing and the instrument.

# on [[perfect pitch]]
Some people have the ability to instantly recognise pitches, this is both a blessing and a curse. It can make one's life easier when learning new musical material, remembering a melody by its real pitches. It does not mean one understands the music on a conceptual level though. 

I would argue that a well developed [[relative pitch]] (the ability to identify the intervals between notes) and solid theoretical knowledge is highly preferable than an untrained perfect pitch.

It is more important to hear that a chord is Major or minor than reciting its pitches and then having to analyse if it is Major or minor. 

# where to start
There are plenty of apps and courses out there to help you train your musical ear, they all more or less work. 

I would advise you start practicing recognising [[intervals]] starting with the smallest, can you identify [[minor Second]] from [[Major Second]]? Then moving on to bigger intervals and eventually [[chord voicings]] or [[arpeggios]].

Also practice singing back melodies you hear in the music you listen to, try to get them accurate.

# the goal
There is no ceiling to one's musical ear, I have seen amazing transcribers who could listen to a song once and write down the changes or the melody. Your ear is like a muscle, it can grow with time or atrophy from lack of use. The more you practice making sense of the music you hear and naming things the better you will get at it.

We should aim at being able to follow the [[form]], the [[chord progressions]] of the songs we play by ear as well as being able to [[transcribing|transcribe]] melodies or solos.
