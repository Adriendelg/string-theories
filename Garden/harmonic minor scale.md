The harmonic minor scale is the structure we use to create the chords for minor [[tonal music]]. We use this one instead of the [[natural minor scale]] because of the presence of a [[dominant]] chord on the 5th degree (V7).


# structure
![[harmonic-minor-intervals.svg]]
The harmonic minor scale features 6 common notes with the [[natural minor scale]] or the relative [[major scale]], only the 7th degree is now sharpened.

Its particular sound comes from the [[augmented 2nd]] the 6th and 7th degree. 


> [!danger] [[enharmonics|enharmonic]] intervals
> Here this 3 semitones interval is called an augmented 2nd and not a minor 3rd because scales are composed of consecutive notes.
