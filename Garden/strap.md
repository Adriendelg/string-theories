Playing with a strap is a great solution to achieve a natural posture with minimal equipment. It can be used to play standing up or sitting down and is cheap and reliable.

# standing up
We all have in mind the image of a rock guitar player strumming power chords with his guitar low on the body. While it may look cool, it's far from ideal for playing anything more complicated than a few chords.

The height of the strap is a really important factor that can enable or hinder your playing. The guitar should ideally be in a position where both hands can achieve a wide range of techniques while being in a relaxed and natural position. 

For a bit of light hearted fun, go watch this [[Christophe Godin]] video comparing a rock and a jazz player: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIRN1Ayz-IQ&t=9s

When playing with a strap, you should consider the general weight of your guitar and its balance. Playing a three hour show with a [[Les Paul]]'s weight on one shoulder might not be the most comfortable or healthy thing you could do. There is also the problem of neck dive with some instruments where the [[headstock]] is too heavy and compromises the balance of the instrument. For this the strap button placement can help.

# sitting
Playing with a strap sitting down can be a great solution to avoid using a [[footstool]] or [[guitar supports|guitar support]], here the length of the strap can be shorter and part of the instrument can be resting on your lap to take some of the weight.
