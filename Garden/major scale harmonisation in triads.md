when we create [[triads]] from every [[scale degrees]] of the [[major scale]], we get this series of Major, minor and diminished chords:
1. Major
2. minor
3. minor
4. Major
5. Major
6. minor
7. diminished

L:1/2
K:C
[CEG] [DFA] | [EGB] [FAc] | [GBd] [Ace] | [Bdf]  |
w: I ii iii IV V vi viiÂ° 
```
here we see them in [[root position]]

since every Major scale is built on the same set of intervals, every major scale is harmonized the same

> [!NOTE] roman numerals for [[scale degrees]]
> we commonly use roman numerals to refer to scale degrees and chords built on them, we use capitalized roman numeral for Major chords and lowercase for minor chords or other chords with a minor third such as diminished

# their [[functions]]
Different chords from the scale play different roles in [[tonal music]], here are the functions for every scale degree:
1. [[tonic]]
2. [[sub dominant]]
3. [[tonic]]
4. [[sub dominant]]
5. [[dominant]]
6. [[tonic]]
7. [[sub dominant]]/[[dominant]]


# how about the relative minor scale?

# going further
There are a lot of other ways to harmonise a scale than just [[triads]], first we can have a look at what happens when we add another third on top of the existing triad structure: [[major scale harmonisation in tetrads]]
