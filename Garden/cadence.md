*Cadences are the punctuation of music. 

A cadence is a short harmonic pattern or [[chord progressions|chord progression]] at the end of a musical phrase. It is a tool for [[tension and release]]. The most common would be the movement from [[dominant]] to [[tonic]], going back to the home chord providing a sense of resolution. 

There are many different types of cadences using two or three chords, some of them present in most music types and some with a more specific sound.
