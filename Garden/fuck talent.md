 I was sitting in front of my school lighting a cigarette, as did most french eighteen years old at the time when they just finished yet another exam. As usual I walked out an hour early handing back pages after pages of cramped cursive I was semi proud of. This one was the written english test for the BaccalaurÃ©at, I knew it was a pass, a good mark even and only really cared about the jazz festival I would attend that night. Waiting on my friends for some early liberation celebration I keep drawing on that cigarette lost in thought. Will [[Pat Metheny]] bring his crazy Picasso guitar ?

"You were the first to come out !" She piped crossing the gate. 
"I guess..."

She was thin and loud, she seemed to have a character way out of proportion to her frail body. We were in the same english class all year and she always seemed to like me.

"It must have been easy for you, I guess you'll have a good mark !" Without leaving me time to answer she went on.

"You're lucky you speak english so well."

This one innocent remark triggered me so deeply I still remember it ten years later. It echoed all the times someone called me talented, all those well-wishing empty words people use. Lucky ? Talented ? As if I was magically born with the ability to speak a second language or play the guitar, as if effort and hard work did not exist. All those hours spent deciphering a foreign language, watching videos and pausing every sentence, reading a blog post with google translate on the side, spending nights reading, listening, learning. All those moments dismissed and replaced by a single word : lucky. 

I had no witty answer to offer then other than a dismissive shrug. I felt angry but couldn't express it without launching into a bitter monologue she did not deserve. I went on with my day and yes, Pat Metheny did bring the Picasso guitar that night and it was unbelievable.

I have come to despise the word talent, most people use it as a compliment and most artists receive it as an insult. It instantly dismisses all the long hours, the blood, sweat and tears willingly offered to something greater than oneself. It belittles effort and takes away merit. It disempowers the individual and reduces it to nothing more than the result of the big lottery of life. It takes away the very idea of choice and free will and makes us nothing more than the Gods playthings. Talent as a word screams powerlessness and [[fixed mindset]], it reeks of resentment toward the talented and leaves a bitter taste. 

Every naive parent dreams of having a talented child, one for whom things come easy. Be careful what you wish for. Being the gifted kid, the one who grows up absorbing knowledge and skill faster than their peer is not a benediction, it is a curse. It doesn't make a parent's life easier, it makes it infinitely harder. It doesn't make your life any smoother, it turns it into a constant battle with yourself. Being gifted, having an easy time learning and acquiring new skills only gets you so far. You might go through school like taking a stroll in the park, you might be rewarded for all the achievements that came so easy, people will tell you how clever and talented you are and you might actually believe it. Until life punches you in the face. 

Someday every gifted kid eventually runs into a solid wall, the first failure, the first task that doesn't come easy and it hurts. When everything was a breeze and didn't require real work, when you never had to build solid learning and practicing habits for your entire life and you encounter your first real challenge you feel naked and powerless. Doubt settles in for all the praise you received are now useless. For the first time in your life, you might actually have to work. 

If learning was effortless, if knowledge just magically stuck to your mind as if your brain was a magnet, how do you learn to work ? Work is not an idea, not a concept, it is discipline, commitment. It's not something you absorb, it's not a thought or a concept it is action. 

Fuck talent, embrace work.
