Natural harmonics are a [[technique]] we can use to produce a tone from the [[harmonic series]]. It is done by lightly touching the string at a certain spot, without fully fretting, that will produce one of the natural overtones of the string plucked. 

They can be found at different precise divisions of the string's length following the [[harmonic series#the pattern|pattern]] of the harmonic series. The first few harmonics are found at fret 12, 7, 5 and 9. Other exist but these are the most common.

Note that the harmonics are also found on the half of the string closer to the bridge and can be played there using a [[claw harmonics]] technique.

> [!NOTE] Repetition of harmonics across strings
> Note how the 5th fret harmonic of most string is found at the 7th fret on the next string, this allows to [[tune with harmonics]].

# on alternate tunings
harmonics are a principle of physics, the same rules apply to [[alternate tunings]], this means that the harmonics will change according to each individual string tuning
