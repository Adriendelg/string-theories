the decay of a note is it's last moments of life, the way it disappears into silence

[[strings in motion]] can not stay in motion forever, once energy has been given to it it will vibrate until stopped or until it runs out of energy

as guitar players we spend a lot of time thinking about how we [[attack]] the strings, how we give birth to a tone but tend to overlook the importance of when they stop

we are essentially birthing countless orphaned notes 

paying attention to how and when a note decays is essential when playing [[polyphony]], there are times when we want or don't want a note to continue ringing over the next

a great example of [[tactical muting]] can be found in [[Michael Hedges]] music in pieces such as [[Aerial Boundaries]] or [[Layover]]
