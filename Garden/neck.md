The neck of the guitar is the interface between your left hand and the instrument.

A very important but invisible element of why you might like a guitar or not. 

Every guitar has a different shape called the [[neck profile]]. They can be thinner, thicker, rounder, flatter, symmetrical or not etc. 

When talking about the neck, we can also mention [[string spacing]] how far apart the strings. 

An underestimated question about the neck is the finish on the back. Some guitars have a high gloss finish that I don't personally enjoy, I prefer a satin or oil finished neck that never sticks to the hand.
