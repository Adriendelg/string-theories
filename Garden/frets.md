Not enough people pay attention to their frets. They come in different material, heights and shapes. 

Most frets are traditionally made of nickel, being softer than steel strings it wears with time. That's why old guitars often need a recrowning of the fret, filing them to restore their shape. 

Now other materials exist such as stainless steel or gold evo, they are both much harder than nickel. They are also harder than the alloy used for steel strings which means you don't kill your frets with time, you ruin [[strings]] instead. This is a trade off I am willing to make. 

The shape and height of the frets also play a good role in an instrument's playability. I personally prefer tall jumbo frets to more vintage low frets. I find that jumbo frets make for easier [[tapping]] and allow for a lighter [[left hand]].
