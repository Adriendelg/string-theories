The headstock of a guitar is a kind of signature for the manufacturer or luthier. Every brand and builder has a certain shape. 

[[classical|classical guitar]], [[acoustic|acoustic guitar]] and [[electric guitar]] have slightly different headstock types.

# classical
classical often have a slotted headstock, one that is hollowed so that the tuners and strings go through it, [[tuners]] are arranged 3 on each side 

you also find this type of headstock on some vintage acoustic guitars

# acoustic
acoustic guitars have solid headstock with three tuners on each side, they are not hollowed like classical guitars 

# electric
electric guitars show more variation in headstock than all other types of guitars, think about [[fender]] and their 6 in line tuners and different headstocks for every model or [[gibson]] with a headstock that looks more like an acoustic guitar's

# headless
over the last few years we've seen a lot more headless guitars, they have no headstock and the tuners are moved to the [[bridge]], strings are locked right before the [[nut]]
