I believe there are left hand principles that apply to every style of guitar playing and every instrument, they are to be adapted to your own personal [[anatomy]] and  needs of the moment.

- Keep your hand parallel to the strings.
- You should never have to squeeze your hand hard. 
- Fingers should maintain their natural curve as much as possible. 
- Fingertips should all be pointed toward the fretboard. 
- You should always aim at [[fretting]] with the very tip of the finger.
- Horizontal shifts should be done with no contact to the neck or strings. 
- Your [[lh thumb|left hand thumb]] default position should be opposed to the middle finger. 
- KEEP YOUR NAILS SHORT. 
- Use the correct [[lh thumb over or behind the neck]] position for the context.
