*"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth."

One way to reduce strain on the [[left hand]] while performing [[barre chords]] is to make use of another strong physical principle: leverage. 

This has everything to do with proper [[lh thumb]] placement behind the neck when performing a barre. 

# the common mistake
Most beginners struggle with barre chords because they place the lh thumb in opposition to the index finger performing the barre and try to squeeze really hard. Not only is this very tiring for the hand muscles, it also doesn't offer the best result. It is a mechanically disadvantageous position to perform the technique. 

# the correct way
If you move your thumb a little toward the pinky side of the hand, opposing the middle finger rather than the index, you create a lever between the thumb and the index doing the barre. Instead of having to squeeze the hand so hard you can now focus on a slight rotational movement of the hand toward the [[headstock]], the leverage point being your thumb behind the neck. 

This greatly reduces the need to squeeze the hand and puts you in a mechanically advantageous position.
