*think like a drummer, feel like a drummer, be a drummer*

One of the best ways to get familiar with [[basic rhythm notation]] fast is to draw from drummer's literature. These guys know all about rhythm and have been studying in great depths. 

This method is a great and progressive book of exercises taking you from the very basics to advanced material

# learning to count
In order to decipher rhythmic notation, we need to learn to count time within a [[bars|bar]] while respecting the [[time signature]]. Let's pick a 4/4 bar to start as it is the most common and easiest to navigate. 


```music-abc
X:1
T:Counting in 4/4 Time
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
%%score align
"1"C "2"C "3"C "4"C| 
L:1/8
"1"C"&"C "2"C"&"C "3"C"&"C "4"C"&"C| 
L:1/16
"1"C"e"C"&"C"a"C "2"C"e"C"&"C"a"C "3"C"e"C"&"C"a"C "4"C"e"C"&"C"a"C|]

```

We count every [[the beat|beat]] with numbers, this is a 4 beats bar. Then we count the second 8th note, the [[offbeat]], as & and finally every 16th note in between as 'e' for the second and 'a' for the fourth.

## examples
Let's look at a few simple rhythms and how we would count them.

```music-abc
X:2
M:4/4
L:1/8
Q:1/4=100
K:C
%%score (V1)
V:1
C2  C  C  C2  C2|
w: 1   2  &   3   4

```
```music-abc
X:1
M:4/4
L:1/8
Q:1/4=100
K:C
%%score (V1)
V:1
C2 C2 C C C2|
w: 1   2   3   &   4

```
