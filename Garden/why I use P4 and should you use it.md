Most of the resource in this vault will make use of both [[standard tuning]] and [[P4 tuning]]. Even though I chose to learn music theory and jazz in P4 I still teach in standard tuning most of the time. I include all the P4 resources partly for myself and partly to show how useful a [[tunings|tuning]] it can be in some situations.

# my story with P4
When I started getting interested in jazz and improvisation after years of classical guitar I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of material I had to learn. Arpeggios, chord shapes, lines and still in standard tuning at the time, I had to adapt this material to different [[string sets]] effectively multiplying the number of shapes to learn by three. This was discouraging. It is also around this time that I discovered [[Tom Quayle]] whose [[legato]] playing I greatly admired. Tom uses P4 tuning and has an intervalic approach to [[fretboard visualisation]] that resonated with me. 

I started to relearn the fretboard in this new matrix. It sped up my learning of arpeggios and chords, suddenly I could move shapes not only up and down the neck but up and down string sets. The consistency felt great to my brain, it had a logic standard tuning was missing. 

A few years later going through music college in the UK I started to face the consequences of my choice. My teachers even though they understood the concept were not familiar with it and showed me new material in standard, it was my job to adapt it to my weird tuning. Also I couldn't just pick up any guitar at a jam session and start playing, people gave me weird looks seeing me retune their instrument. Most of the material you will find online is in standard tuning, I had to learn to read tabs in standard, correct by one fret and play it in P4. It also made me practice [[sight reading]] again, having to create new [[muscle memory]] for my top two strings. 

While it made learning intricate jazz material easier by reducing redundancy, it also made a lot of basic material harder. The first [[pentatonic]] scale we all learn was now crooked, it didn't have this nice bar. All the simple [[open chords]] were not available anymore having changed my two open strings. Most guitar players friendly keys such as E and A became harder to play in while F, Bb and Eb, the horn players keys became easier. 

Now years later I still use P4 for jazz and when composing. It became a comfortable matrix I rely on when composing. Being a very lousy keyboard player it feels nice to have a composing tool that is easy to understand and regular. I still play classical guitar in standard tuning and learn fingerstyle tunes in standard but when I think of a line or a chord, I picture it in P4. The guitar in my mind is tuned to fourths.

However, being a guitar teacher I had to develop the ability to switch to standard and adapt my material to the tuning my students play in. Just like being bilingual, I can now switch from one to the other. Of course one feels more like a mother tongue and the other one like a foreign language but I can navigate them quite effortlessly. They can both do most of the same things but are best tuned (pun totally intended) for slightly different circumstances.

# should you?
It all depends on your musical goals and how comfortable you are with working things out yourself. 

P4's strength is the reduction of the numbers of fingerings and the regularity of its matrix. Losing the ability to rely on most available teaching resources is only worth it if you want to learn advanced harmony and improvisation and are ready to spend a lot of time relearning the fretboard. I would only recommend it to people who are very serious about jazz or fusion and have the time and energy to dedicate to it. For all the rest I would stay stick to [[standard tuning]] for how easy it is to find good material. 

P4 is a very specific tool for very specific needs, it only works with people who have a certain type of brain that values consistency over ease of access.

Making the switch to P4 after years of standard tuning is hard and frustrating, the first few weeks will be a pain. It takes a long time to unlearn habits and replace them with new ones. This makes it harder to switch the longer you've been learning the fretboard in standard tuning. 

Having the ability to switch our instrument's layout in a few seconds is one of the guitar's strength. You don't have to commit to a tuning forever. You can try P4 and see how it feels for you, I have had students that tried it for a while before going back to standard and gained some better understanding of the fretboard from the experience. 

And maybe neither standard nor P4 is right for you and you only like [[alternate tunings]] and that's fine too. The guitar is not fixed, it is mutable, find your comfort tuning and learn it well. At the end of the day, no one cares about how you tune, the only important thing is playing music you like easily.
