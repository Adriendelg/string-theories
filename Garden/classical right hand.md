the classical guitar makes use of long [[nails]] on the playing hand, its main technical specificities are:
- a high wrist
- straighter fingers
- use of all fingers except the pinky
- no [[anchoring a finger]]
- multiple complex and extended right hand techniques
	- [[free strokes]]
	- [[rest strokes]]
	- [[tremolo]]
	- [[rasgueados]]
	- [[claw harmonics]]

hand position and angle of [[attack]] on the strings varies from player to player due to technical demand of the repertoire, teacher lineage, morphology, desired tone etc.

we find two main schools of classical guitar right hand technique:
- [[left side attack]]
