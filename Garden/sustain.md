the sustain is how long a note rings

it is what happens after you set the [[strings in motion]] and before they naturally stop or you stop them: the [[decay]]

the sustain of a note is influenced by many factors such as the quality of the instrument, how healthy the strings are, potential effects when amplified etc. 

unlike the voice, wind instruments or bowed strings instruments, the guitar can't sustain a tone indefinitely without some technological trickery

this means that true [[legato]] does not exist and we are forced to take the [[decay]] into account
