# how to make a sound with this instrument?
*Reduced to its core, the only requirement is to set a string in motion. 

# what is technique
Technique is the art of controlling movement. Your own movement and [[posture]], how your [[right hand]] and [[left hand]] move. How you set [[strings in motion]]. 

Having a good technique is showing [[mastery]] of all those movements and more. 

# my view on technique
## ideal technique
There is such a thing as the best bio-psycho-mechanical way to [[use]] your body and mind to achieve a musical goal, an engineered way taking into account your morphology, instrument dimensions, string tension, contact surface with the string (and plenty more factors) to craft the tone you desire.

There is a way to perform the music exactly as you intend it while spending the minimal amount of energy, without wasting resources and creating strain. 

The perfect technique consist of executing this best theoretical way all the time.

Note that this definition relies on the existence of a musical goal, a clear mental picture of what things should sound like. This is [[audiation]] or inner hearing and is one of the most important concepts in music learning. 

## getting there
There's only been one Jesus and one Buddha but we still consider them ideals. Just because something is or seems unattainable doesn't mean we should not aim for it. 

I haven't witnessed a guitar player that had the perfect technique. I have seen glimpses of it in the performance of some masters. I have experienced it myself for short bursts of time. Moments of [[flow]] where things were truly [[effortless]]. 

Having made the experience and being lucky enough to have seen great examples of it only motivates me to work for it knowing fully I won't ever reach perfection. 

## how
*Discipline will set you free.*
1. have a clear musical intention
2. truly know the parameters at hand
3. engineer a solution
4. deliberate practice
5. review
6. repetition
