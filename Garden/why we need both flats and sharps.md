this questions comes often from students, the best way to illustrate it is to show how difficult to read and absurd a notation with only sharps or flats would work 

yes G# and Ab are the same fret on guitar or the same key on piano (they are called [[enharmonics]]) but naming them one way or the other has importance

let's imagine G# Major, following the [[major scale]] formula of WWHWWWH we would end up with this abomination:

only altered notes and two double sharps which would make reading the music impractical 

now compare it to the correct and way more practical Ab Major:

we preserve some natural notes and avoid double alterations

note the turning point in the [[tonality#circle of fifths|circle of fifths]] at F# Major which could also be Gb Major where we choose to switch from sharps to flats or flats to sharps in order to preserve legibility
