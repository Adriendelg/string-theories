One of the particularities of guitar is the repetition of the same pitch on different strings. As every individual string acts as a small keyboard featuring an ascending series of [[the 12 semitones|semitones]], we can find the same exact note at different spots on the fretboard. 

For example here are the repetitions of the high E string pitch before the 12th fret in standard tuning:

Notice how it is found on the 5th fret of the B string and 9th of the G string. It could also be found at the 14th of the D string and 19th of the A string.

# why its useful
Having the same note at different places on the [[fretboard]] can be confusing at first, only stringed instruments feature this kind of logic (also saxophones but their instrument matrix is on another level of headache). This allows for multiple fingerings possibilities of the same material. This allows the player to choose which one is more appropriate in the current musical context. 

Different strings having different [[string gauges|gauges]] or thickness, the same pitch on two different strings will have a slightly different tone. It is your job as the player to choose which one feels and sounds best in the moment.
