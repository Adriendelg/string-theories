Chord refers to a combination of at least 3 notes (2 notes being an [[intervals|interval]]). 

There is an infinite number of possible chords. 

There are different systems to classify chords, jazz and classical traditions use different naming conventions for mostly the same material. I personally prefer to use 'jazz names' as they are the most commonly found and used.

# where to start
The most used and basic chords are [[triads]] and [[tetrads]].
