# Gear considerations for alternate tunings
One thing to keep in mind when exploring alternate tunings is that the guitar and its strings are often not designed to be played in something else than standard tuning. This means that you might have to tweak some aspects of your setup to get the best tone and playability out of alternate tunings. 

Alternate tunings tend to explore lower pitches than standard tuning as raising the tension too high will be hard for your instrument and strings to manage. In order to keep an appropriate tension you might have to use heavier strings than you are used to. A basic rule in my opinion would be to never use gauges lighter than .12/.53. 

Another thing to keep in mind when exploring deeper than standard tunings is string tension and relief of the neck. A typical acoustic guitar tuned to standard tuning holds between 45 and 60kg of tension. Your truss rod is generally adjusted to offer a playable action for this range and string gauge. If you suddenly decide to use much lower tunings you might have to adjust your setup slightly to provide the appropriate neck relief. 

A factor that plays on the tunings you can use is scale length. Most acoustic guitars have a 25.5 inches scale length which is optimised for standard tuning. To allow for deeper more full sounding bass a longer scale length can help. This is the point of all those cool looking fan fret guitars that have been coming out lately. Having a longer scale length on the bass allows for deeper tunings. It's all physics, think about a harp or the inside of a piano, the bass strings are longer in order for them to resonate fully.
