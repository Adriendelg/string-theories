### Specific modal tunings
> [!info]+ Modes and open tunings
> Some open tunings spell complex chords with extensions that belong to specific modes. They have a particular colour and offer great sounding open strings and harmonics, they can be harder to navigate due to their specificity. 

- Eb Lydian â†’ Eb G D A Bb C
- D Dorian â†’ D G C F B E
- C Aeolian â†’ C Ab Bb Eb Ab C
- E Dorian â†’ E G D F# A C#
- D Lydian â†’ D A C# G# A D

These are harder to find but are worthy of exploration.
