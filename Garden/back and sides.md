If the [[sound board|top]] is the skin of the drum, the back and sides are the body. If the [[sound board]] is to vibrate freely, the back and sides need to provide it a stable and rigid structure.

The back and sides are made from the same wood and reinforced in places. They give rigidity to the guitar. 

They are traditionally made of rosewood or mahogany but many other materials have been used.
