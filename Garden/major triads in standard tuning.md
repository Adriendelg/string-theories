[[triads]] are the some of the basic building blocks of music, here are the different positions for all three [[inversions]] for a C [[Major triad]] in [[standard tuning]].

These shapes are to be moved horizontally to fit different [[tonality|keys]].

> [!NOTE] [[string sets]]
> Notice how the fingerings stay the same for string sets 654 and 543 as their tuning is consistent and how the shapes have to adapt to the presence of a [[Major 3rd]] in [[standard tuning]] for string sets 432 and 321
