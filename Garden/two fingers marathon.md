This exercise also works out fingers in pairs just like the [[switch from hell]] exercise, only this time we will move up and down the neck on every string. 

# how to do it
- start with the first finger pair 1&2
- play fret 1 and 2 on every string starting from the 6th
- when you reach the top string move up one fret
- play fret 3 and 2 on every string from the 1st to the 6th
- when you reach the lowest string move up one fret and ascend playing the two consecutive frets on every string from low to high
- repeat the process until fret 12
- now add a fret in between the two fingers and descend the neck reversing the pattern
- when done repeat with the second (2&3) and third (3&4) pairs of fingers

# why it's good and best way to practice it
This exercise makes you practice [[fretting]] while reducing the number of variables so you can focus on proper execution. Good posture, hand placement and good tone should be the priority. Be mindful of [[common left hand mistakes]] and apply [[simple principles for a great left hand]]. 

You should practice this exercise with a metronome starting with a slow tempo. It's normal to be slower with fingers 2&3 and even slower with fingers 3&4. Keep notes of the tempo you can perform the exercise cleanly with every pair of fingers and try to speed it up slowly over days/weeks.
