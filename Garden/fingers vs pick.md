this is another huge debate with guitar players, which should we learn first? which is the most efficient? which is appropriate for what music?

as you'll see in every similar controversy, I choose to adopt a non judgmental position and explore the pros and cons of both until eventually integrating them both into my playing

# pros and cons of playing with fingers
## the strengths of playing with the fingers
- it is so easy to play any two notes or chord at the same time with no delay
- it is much easier to manage multiple voices, playing [[polyphony]] or [[counterpoint]]
- arpeggios are simple to execute
- no "third person" between the player and the strings, closer relationship
- can perform a great variety of movements from scales, arpeggios, rasgueados, strumming etc.
- anything that requires independent voices such as [[bossa nova]], [[fingerpicking]] 
- fingers are always with you and don't fall inside the guitar
- no problems with [[string skipping]]
- huge variety of different tones available

## the downsides of playing with the fingers
- super fast shredder like scales are harder if you don't shed [[rest strokes]] like [[Matteo Mancuso]]
- if you choose to play with [[nails]] maintenance is an time investment and things can go wrong
- strumming sound is not on par with the pick for some styles
- fine motor skills are harder to develop at first and take a life time to perfect
- easier to develop bad habits at first

# pros and cons of the pick
## the pros of the pick
- simpler to start with
- comes in many shapes, thickness and material allowing one to find his grail and/or use different picks for different contexts
- scales and single notes are easy to execute with an even tone
- strumming is much easier and has a better tone (think funky patterns or gentle strum of an acoustic guitar)
- easier to achieve a strong and loud tone on acoustic 
- pick stay consistent unlike nails, worst case use a fresh pick
- easier to maintain an even tone, the same surface is playing every string
- playing with the pick naturally creates a certain articulation that is hard to reproduce with the fingers, a lot of the inflections of jazz guitar players are created by their picking technique
- the pick is generally louder than the fingers, it helps being heard in a band setting. Think about [[Freddy Green]] strumming an acoustic [[archtop]] in a big band
 - some styles require the use of a pick to achieve the typical tone, think gipsy jazz
 - the pick has a stronger more aggressive attack than the fingers, it is a big part of the sound of [[rock]] and [[metal]], try and play djenty riffs with only your fingers...

## the cons of playing with a pick
- little bugger has a habit of vanishing 
- playing notes on different strings at the same time is impossible except with [[hybrid picking]], [[polyphony]] becomes a challenge
- string skipping is much harder
- some techniques such as [[artificial harmonics]] or tapping require sleight of hand tricks
- not feeling the strings under your fingers as well 

# which is better and why it's both
Once again, it is undeniable that there are amazing masters of the instruments that uses exclusively one or the other. Some players have a way to make everything work with or without a pick, think [[Matteo Mancuso]] shredding fusion on an electric guitar with nails or [[Pasquale Grasso]] playing the most intricate jazz lines and harmony with a pick or [[Nelson Veras]] playing the craziest fast runs with his fingers only. 

It is also true that some particular techniques work better with or without the pick, strumming a folk song sounds infinitely better with a pick, playing [[Bach]] will always be easier with the fingers. 

Just like this other controversy, [[lh thumb over or behind the neck]], I personally chose to learn both and use them in different contexts. I believe that a well rounded player should be able to switch from one to the other depending on their musical need. 

# hard work pays off
I know that learning both to use the pick and fingers is like learning half a new instrument, that it takes that much longer. But nothing worth having comes easy. You might prefer one or the other but I highly encourage you to explore at least the basics of the other, they are both amazing tools.
