What happens before you play any note. 

Your fingers don't move of their own accord, a signal has to be sent from your brain. You intend to play a certain note, consciously or subconsciously evaluate the needed movements and send the order to your fingers through your nervous system.

Too often we make the mistake of blaming our fingers rather than the brain sending the order. If the message is not clear enough, if the mental image of what is required is not clear enough there is no way the fingers will perform the appropriate movements. 

It's therefore of the highest importance of being able to imagine the movements, to [[audiation|audiate]] what you intend to play, to hold as accurate a mental picture as you can.
