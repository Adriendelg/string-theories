Any note added to a [[tetrads|tetrad]] can be considered an extension. As tetrads are the biggest [[chords|chord]] we can create by piling thirds within an octave, any note beyond that octave such as a [[Major 9th]] or a [[Sharp 11th]] is an extension.

What extension can be used on what chord is decided by the [[scales|scale]] one is in at the moment. Some chords such as [[Major 7]] can only be extended by a handful of notes before sounding radically different while some others like [[7 chords]] can be extended with a lot of different options and keep their role and [[functions]] intact.
