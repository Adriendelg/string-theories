I believe there is such a thing as musical literacy, the skill of reading, writing and understanding music. Just like any skill, this can be developed to incredible levels of proficiency.

It has nothing to do with [[fuck talent|talent]] and all to do with learning and [[practice]]. 

As one has to start somewhere, here is what I consider the bare minimum for any beginner player.
# what are we dealing with?
[[the 12 semitones]]
[[the beat]]
[[intervals]]
# reading music
[[what it means to read music]]
[[the staff]]
[[basic rhythm notation]]
# guitar specific
[[reading tablatures]]
[[understanding chord diagrams]]
