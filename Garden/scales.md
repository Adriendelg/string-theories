> [!NOTE] Definition
> A scale is a collection of 5 or more notes contained within an octave from which we derive [[melody|melodies]] and [[harmony]]. 


We differentiate scales by their series of [[intervals]] and the number of notes to the octave. 

# 5 notes scales, pentatonics
- [[minor pentatonic]]
- [[major pentatonic]] 

# 6 notes scales, hexatonics
- [[triad pairs]]
- [[whole tone scale]]

# 7 notes scales, heptatonics
- [[major scale]]
- [[minor scales]]
	- [[harmonic minor scale]]
	- [[natural minor scale]]
	- [[melodic minor scale]]
- [[harmonic major scale]]

# 8 notes scales, octatonics
- [[diminished scale]]

# categorising scales
There are many ways to organise all the possible scales and [[modes]], while most popular music only uses two or three scales [[jazz]] and [[modern classical music]] uses a lot more. Itâ€™s therefore useful to have a few ways to make sense and classify the different scales we will encounter. 

## by function
Beyond the number of notes, we can use the [[functions|function]] of the [[tonic|tonic chord]] of each mode to classify them by [[tonic]], [[sub dominant]] or [[dominant]] family. 

In this vault, each modeâ€™s analysis page will feature a function property. 

## by transposibility 
There are scales such as the major scale or the minor pentatonic that can be played on any of [[the 12 semitones]], they can be transposed to any [[tonality|key]]. 

Some other weirder scales such as the [[whole tone scale]] or the [[diminished scale]] have a limited number of transpositions. For example the whole tone scale has only two transpositions (one starting on C one on Db). 

Modes of limited transposition are much rarer and mostly used in modern jazz or contemporary classical music. 

# [[modes]]
Modes are a different arrangement of the pitches of a parent scale. While the parent scale is used for [[tonal music]], the mode created from the scale is used in [[modal music]].
