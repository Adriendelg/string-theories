the acoustic guitar or steel string guitar uses steel strings and different body shapes differentiating it from the [[classical|classical guitar]]

it has a long history spanning multiple continents 

the most common body shapes from smallest to largest are:
- parlor
- OM 
- auditorium
- dreadnaughts
- jumbo
- super jumbo

they feature a 14 fret to the body construction most of the time and have a narrower string spacing than classical, the fingerboard also usually features a [[radius]]

due to their nature they are easier to achieve a good amplified tone with and can make use of many [[amplification systems]]
