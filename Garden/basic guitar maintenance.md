Taking care of your guitar is easy and doesn't require crazy tools or skills. Keeping your instrument in good playing conditions is really important as much for its longevity than for your comfort.

# keep your strings fresh
Friendly reminder, you need to [[changing strings|change strings]] regularly. When they get rusty and have spots all over is already late. Unless you are going for that vintage [[Nick Drake]] tone please change your strings whenever they start to sound dull and feel like they don't glide anymore. 

To extend the life of your strings I would recommend to clean them after every playing session, steel strings can be cleaned with WD40, make sure not to get some on the fretboard though. You can also use fast-fret to keep a thin layer of oil on them and prevent oxydation. 

What [[strings brand and models]] you use will influence how long they last.

# keep that guitar clean
For the love of all that is sacred please clean your fingerboard and frets once in a while. All the shit that is on your hands, the dead skin, grime, dirt will accumulate on the fretboard. For this I use [[gorgomyte]], as advised by my luthier. It works wonder and makes your fretboard spotless and your frets as shiny as the day you got your guitar.

To clean the body of fingermarks and oil please make sure you use an appropriate cleaner for your type of finish. There are different types of finish used on different instruments and they don't all like the same stuff.

# make sure your action is how you like it
The [[action]] of a guitar refers to how high the strings are relative to the frets. High action makes a guitar harder to play. You can use a simple ruler to check how high your strings are at the 12th fret and document the evolution. A guitar being made of wood it will react to change in temperature and humidity and very slightly move. 

In order to keep your action at a desired height you might need to tighten or loosen the [[truss rod]] with an allen key or raise/lower your bridge saddle. If this sounds scary please consult someone knowledgeable to teach you in person.

# keep a [[soldering iron]] 
You never know when a jack lead will go loose or when a contact will break, having basic soldering skills and a soldering iron at home can save you a trip to the guitar tech for something really simple.
