If you are reading this, chances are that you want to get better at playing the guitar. 

But have you ever stopped and defined what it means to you?

The very idea of getting better at anything requires a goal, a direction otherwise how would you know if you made progress? One has to have a scale to measure progress.

Becoming a good guitar player means different things to different people, some might want to be able to play a few songs for their family and that's a great goal. Some want to be a fluent jazz improviser, a singer songwriter, an accomplished classical soloist, a mind-blowing shredder, a competent teacher, an all-rounder etc. and these are all great goals as well. 

What is your goal?

For someone to stick to the discipline of regular focused practice required to make any progress, they need to experience positive emotions while doing it. The only way to experience pleasure from rigorous practice is when moving towards a goal. There is no positive emotion without an aim. 

What are you aiming at?

# formulate your goals
Take some time and reflect, meditate on why you want to spend time with the instrument. Write it down, make it as clear as you can. 

Where do you ideally want your playing to be?

It doesn't have to be realistic, it can be unattainable and slightly crazy. It's the horizon point towards which you take daily steps. 

What does it mean to you to get good at the guitar?

For me getting good means having a wide range of tools and knowledge to assist writing, performing and teaching the music I enjoy irregardless of genre. I want to be a competent musician and guitar player in as wide a domain as I can. I want to be a great teacher, scholar, interpret and composer. I know that this is an open ended goal with no ceiling but I can feel progress daily when engaging with new material. I keep adding bricks to a cathedral I will never finish.
# why
Figuring out where you want to go is the first step. Knowing WHY you want to get there is the key to a healthy relationship with practice itself, it is the only way to not get discouraged along the way. Imagining where you want your playing to be is easy, knowing the deep 'why' you want to get there is hard but it is where true meaning lies. 

To me, collecting knowledge and skills about music and the guitar feels like my life task, to borrow a term from Adlerian psychology. It's what I'm good at, it's what I enjoy, it's what people pay me for, it's where I can contribute to the community. I want to get good in order to give back to the music community that has given me so much.

# now what
Once you have a clear direction written down you can start planning, what would it require? Where are you currently at? What should you work on? How do I get there?

Once you know where you want to go and why you can finally work on a plan to get there. Practice now means something. It's not a thing you have to do, it's something you want to do.
