Intervals are the name we give to the space between two notes. 
# why they matter
We will use intervals to analyse [[chord structures]] and [[melody|melodies]], to describe scales and [[modes]], to navigate the [[fretboard]]. They are one of the most useful building block of music. 

Here is a table of all useful intervals:

| Half Steps | Interval Name      | Common Abbreviation | Example from C | Notes                |     |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | --- |
| 0          | [[Unison]]         | P1                  | C to C         | Same note            |     |
| 1          | [[minor 2nd]]      | m2                  | C to Db        | One semitone         |     |
| 2          | [[Major 2nd]]      | M2                  | C to D         | Whole step           |     |

Note that we haven't named all possible intervals that span two octaves. The [[second octave]] only features the useful [[chord extensions]] we will encounter. A fifth is a fifth wether it is in the first octave or the second from the [[root]] of a chord.
