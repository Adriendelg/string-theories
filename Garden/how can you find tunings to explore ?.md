# How can you find tunings to explore ?
One of the easiest ways to discover a new tuning is to cover a song that uses it. I have stolen countless tunings from Jon Gomm, Erik Mongrain or Michael Hedges. There is no shame in borrowing a tuning from another piece. It is also a great way to start getting familiar in this new tuning. The best way to become more fluent in a tuning is to learn, improvise and compose music in it. 

You could also have a more theoretical approach and have a specific chord you want to turn into a new tuning. This will require some harmonic ingenuity as well as knowledge about your instrument and its setup. Not all guitars and string gauges like higher or lower tunings. 

The last way to discover a tuning would be exploration. Start in a tuning you know and alter one string or more until you stumble upon something that sounds good to your ear. 

There are no rules in alternate tunings, whatever leads you there is a totally valid process
