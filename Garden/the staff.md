Music is written on a set of five lines. It operates in two dimensions, the vertical height of each dot represents [[pitch]], the horizontal unfolding of notes from left to right and the markings on the note's stems represent rhythm. 

Those five lines are like a ladder on which notes are hung. Notes can be placed either on a line or in between two. The higher on the ladder the note is, the higher its pitch. 

Guitar sheet music uses a single staff and a [[treble clef]] showing where the note G is. Notice the line where the treble clef starts indicating the note G.

> [!NOTE] Ledger lines
> Note the added 3 lines below the staff to write a low E, as the range of the guitar is much wider than the staff and we have chosen to only use one staff (as opposed to piano) low and high notes will need ledger lines above and below the staff. It is parts of the [[quirks in guitar notation]]. 

# the clef
Note the treble clef at the very beginning of the staff, this is the key we use when writing guitar music. Piano uses it as well as the bass clef, they need both as the range of their instrument is wider than the guitar and using only one key would lead to an excess of ledger lines above and below the staff. Bass players read the bass clef. There also exists other clefs for different orchestral instruments.


> [!NOTE] Little 8 below treble clef for guitar
> Most people don't know the guitar is a transposing instrument, it reads an octave below what other treble clefs instruments would play. It's one of the [[quirks in guitar notation]].

# the [[time signature]]
The 4 4 right after the clef indicate what type of measure we are dealing with.

# the [[key signature]]
the [[accidentals]] at the beginning of the sheet indicating the [[tonality]]
