In the lineage of players such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Merle Travis]] or more contemporary [[Tommy Emmanuel]], has evolved a right hand technique that makes use of the [[fingers]] and [[flesh]], usually with a [[thumb pick]] that looks and sounds quite different from the [[classical right hand]]. 

The wrist is usually much closer to the strings if not anchored to the [[bridge]] or [[palm muting]] the bass strings.  Fingers are more curled and the thumb is more parallel to the strings. 

This position changes the [[attack]] and therefore the tone of the instrument. It is better suited for [[boom chick]] style of alternate bass.

> my default right hand position is much closer to [[classical guitar technique]] but I sometimes switch to a fingerpicking position when performing this type of repertoire or accessing different tones I canâ€™t get otherwise
