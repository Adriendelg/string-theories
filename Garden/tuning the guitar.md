tuning the instrument means adjusting the tension of each string until they play the correct desired pitch, the most common arrangement is [[standard tuning]]

tuning the guitar is the first thing you should do when picking it up, [[why you should always tune first]]

there are multiple techniques and tools you can use to tune the instrument

# with a tuner
electronic tuners have become very good over the last 20 years, they are now cheap and precise

most come in the form of a clip on that we usually put on the [[headstock]] or an app on your phone or tablet

they will feature a needle of some sort that will move according to how high the note played is, the goal is to align the needle with the notch on display ensuring the string plays the correct pitch by loosening or tightening the string with the [[tuners|tuner]]

# by ear
## [[tune with harmonics]]
in most tunings some harmonics on a string will also be found on another string such as 5th fret of the low E to 7th fret on the A string, tuning with harmonics is very precise due to the perfect intonation of harmonics compared to fretted notes
## at the 5th fret
to tune to [[standard tuning]] or [[P4 tuning]], we can use [[note repetition on the fretboard]], the 5th fret of a string will play the same note as the next open string 
(except between the 3rd and 2nd in standard tuningz
)
