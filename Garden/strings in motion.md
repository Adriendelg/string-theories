There is physics involved in playing the guitar, understanding the basic principles behind how a string produces a tone can help you make sense of different [[technique|techniques]] or concepts. 

A guitar string is fixed at both ends, at the [[nut]] and at the [[bridge]] when played open or between a specific fret and the bridge when [[fretting]]. This length of string is the one that will vibrate when plucked. 

When set in motion by [[fingers]] or [[pick]], the string will move back and forth, it will oscillate in a fixed pattern that fits the two points of contact. It will move as one "big wave" producing the fundamental (the note we intend to play) as well as smaller divisions producing [[harmonic series|a series of harmonics]]. We express the speed of these waves and the audible pitch they create in hertz.

shorter string = faster waves = higher hertz = higher pitch 

The combination of fundamental and harmonics constitute this particular note's tone. 

# for acoustic 
The movement of the string is transferred to the bridge which in turn makes the [[sound board]] vibrate amplifying the vibrations of the string and creating an audible tone. 

# for electric
The movement of the string is picked up by the [[pickup]] which in turn translates it into electric signal sent to the [[amp]]. 


# some remarks
- longer strings produce lower notes
- we can only shorten a string, it can't produce a note lower than its open note
- how wide a string moves is called the amplitude and influences how loud it is
- thicker strings need more energy to move than thinner ones
- which harmonics becomes easily audible is highly influenced by which area of the [[sound board]] is vibrating, this is why the [[bracing]] of a guitar is important
- low notes need longer strings to produce a full tone, this is why [[fanned frets]] exist
