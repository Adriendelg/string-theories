The tonic is the starting note of a [[scales|scale]] or [[mode]], it can also refer to its first chord. 
In C major, C is the tonic, CM triad is its tonic chord. 

In [[tonal music]] the tonic plays the role of “home”, of stability this is the note and chord around which the system is organised. Any other note or chord from the scale will have varying levels of pull or attraction to this tonic. 

The tonic is often labelled I or I in Roman numerals when mentioned in a [[chord progressions|chord progression]] or [[cadence]]. 

It is the place we resolve to for the most satisfying and final sounding cadence, it is the chord that our [[dominant|dominant chord]] is most attracted to. 


> [!DANGER] do not mistake tonic for the [[root]]
> the root of a chord is its bass note when in [[root position]], therefore in the key of CMajor there exists a Dm7 chord whose root is D but the tonic in this [[tonality]] is still C
