All of our western musical tradition is based on a division of the octave in 12 notes spaced apart by semitones, they form the chromatic scale. They are our smallest [[intervals]]. The consecutive keys on a piano or the consecutive frets of the same string on a guitar are semitones. 

# They are divided between:
- natural notes, the white keys on the piano
- altered notes also called [[accidentals]], the black keys featuring sharps â™¯ and flats â™­
	- sharps â™¯ raise a note by a semitone
	- flats â™­ lower a note by a semitone

> [!NOTE] the guitar is really 6 pianos
>  the guitar is really six stacked keyboards starting on different notes

A common question is [[why we need both flats and sharps]].

The 12 semitones are also often represented in the form of a clock face to better explain the concept or [[tonality]].
