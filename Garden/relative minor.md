 a relative minor scale is another arrangement of the notes of the [[major scale]], it shares all of the same notes and only starts at another point in the cycle of whole and half steps it is technically a [[mode|mode]] of the major scale.

note the use of the same exact pitches, only white notes on the keyboard, only the pattern now starts on the 6th note of the major scale, its [[tonic]] is no longer C but A

Just like the major scale, the relative minor can be harmonized, start with [[minor scale harmonisation in triads]] and move on to [[harmonic minor scale harmonisation in triads]]


> [!TIP] easily find the relative minor to any Major key
> The relative minor will always be on the 6th degree of the Major key. It means it starts a [[Major 6th]] above or a [[minor third]] below the tonic of the Major scale. ^ssajd5
