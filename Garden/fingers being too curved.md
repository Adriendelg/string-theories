When the wrist is collapsed and too close too the guitar, the fingers will need to curl in a claw-like position. This will highly restrict the movements of the fingers, the hand is no longer able to open and close naturally. 

This will mess with the [[attack]] and create a much weaker tone than one could get while also creating a lot of unnecessary tension. It makes one pick from a weak knuckle rather than a strong one.

> The [[wrist]] should be quite flat or have a slight convex angle rather than concave, this allows for the fingers to keep their natural curve and stand tall to the strings. The opening and closing of the hand is easy and the plucking movement is initiated with the strongest first knuckle.
