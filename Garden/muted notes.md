Muted or dead notes happen when something is in the way of the string freely vibrating between the [[frets|fret]] and the [[bridge]]. It can be due to:

- the finger pressing on the fret rather than right before
- the palm or some other finger touching the string between the fret and bridge
- the finger is not pushing the string enough to make contact with the string

To fix you need to make sure the two points of contact of the strings are the fret you intend and the bridge, nothing touching the string in between.
