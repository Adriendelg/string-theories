This irritating noise happens when the finger pressing the string is too far back in the fret and not close enough to the actual metal bar. It can also sometimes be due to a bad [[setup]] of the guitar. I've found that it is way more often the fault of the player than the instrument's.

In order to fix buzzing you need to push your fretting finger further along the string and close to the fret. This is a key tenant of the [[simple principles for a great left hand]].
