I see a lot of beginners make mistakes when they pluck the strings. The most common stems from a misconception of how [[attack]] works on the guitar. 

> [!fail] unpleasant clacking sounds
>  You should never make contact with the string from below and create tension by pulling it away from the guitar. This is usually accompanied by [[plucking from the hand]] creating a lot of unnecessary movement. 

This leads to the string bouncing back against the fret making a strident clacking sound. 


> [!success] instead
> Gently push the string toward the inside of the instrument and toward the ceiling for the fingers and the ground for the thumb. This should be as simple as making a closing motion with your hand. The same principles apply when playing with a [[pick]].

Alice Artzt a great classical guitar educator has a great example of this on her first video about [[Ida Presti]]'s right hand technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW1pDXnSGxI
