This is one of the most important concept in all of music and is so often overlooked it's criminal. I believe this should be the first music theory class. 

The harmonic series is one of the fundamental patterns in sound.

When anything vibrates, like [[strings in motion]], they don't just oscillate at one frequency - they oscillate at other faster frequencies simultaneously. 

# the pattern
- the string vibrates at a low, main frequency called the fundamental
- it also vibrates at different multiples of this frequency called harmonics
	- 1st harmonic is twice the fundamental
	- 2nd is 3x
	- 3rd is 4x
	- etc.

# harmonics
Note the first few intervals created naturally by the harmonics, they explain a lot of why we find some intervals [[consonant]] or [[dissonant]]. This is the basis of much of [[music theory]].

The [[Perfect Octave|octave]] and [[Perfect Fifth]] are the most consonant intervals because they come very early in the harmonic series. When you play a note you naturally hear its octave up and perfect fifth. 

this also explain the [[natural harmonics]] found at different frets of the guitar

> [!NOTE] Notice what scale emerges from the harmonic series
> If we analyse one by one the first 12 notes of the harmonic series and arrange their pitches consecutively, we end up with this scale formula R M2 M3 #4 P5 m7 which is very close to the [[lydian dominant scale]], a [[mode]] of the [[melodic minor scale]].
