Wether [[fretting]] or doing a [[barre chords|barre chord]], one way to reduce the amount of energy needed is to make use of a strong natural force that is omnipresent. As guitar players we are lucky to have one of the forces of nature helping us perform. 

Gravity pulling everything down toward the ground can assist you in fretting notes. Your left arm has a certain weight, gravity is pulling it down, this can greatly help you with pushing strings down. 

The principle of [[fretting]] a note consists of making a string meet a fret. In order to achieve this two forces are at play:
1. the squeezing motion between the [[lh thumb]] and [[lh fingers]] that acts on a horizontal plane parallel to the ground and requires strength of the hand
2. the natural force of gravity pulling your arm toward the ground

Balancing those two forces is essential in order not to waste energy, one costs effort while the other one comes free. Thank you Universe!

One way to become more conscious of the natural weight of your arm assisting you is to visualise a weight tied to your left elbow when playing. Feel the weight of your arm being pulled toward the ground. This is a matter of [[relaxation]], of surrendering your arm to gravity. When we hold too much tension, it becomes impossible to leverage the natural forces present around us. When you fight gravity with muscle tension, you lose the ability to use it. 

Try to spend some time focusing on the feeling of a very relaxed left arm only clinging on the strings with the fingertips like a climber on a wall. 

A demonstration I like to make to my students is that after mastering this you can actually play pretty difficult music, including barre chords, without the [[lh thumb]] behind the neck at all.
