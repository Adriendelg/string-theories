*man needs a good nut*

The nut is the small piece at the junction between the [[headstock]] and the [[fretboard]] through which the [[strings]] go. It is traditionally made out of bone, now some new materials have emerged. It serves the purpose of feeding the strings in a straight line and giving the open strings a point to rest on.

The height of the nut and the depths of the individual string grooves plays a huge part in the [[setup]] of an instrument.
