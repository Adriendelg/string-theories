Usually used to qualify an [[intervals]] or a [[chords|chord]] dissonant is often synonymous to unpleasant to the ear. But what makes a musical structure unpleasant or unharmonious is the clash of [[harmonic series|harmonics]] generated by the different notes of the structure. If the harmonics generated by every note don't share some common notes, it will sound clashing.

Dissonance is highly contextual, as we can see with different chord voicings containing [[clusters]], when changing what is around the dissonant interval, we can end up with a rather pleasing structure. 

The feeling of a musical element being unpleasant and dissonant is also relative to one's familiarity with the material. When you are not used to [[melodic minor scale]] chords for example, they might sound unpleasant at first until your ear gets used to their sound and considers them normal.
