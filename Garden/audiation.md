*the music in your mind*

# what it is
Audiation is auditory visualisation, the ability to hear sounds in your mind's ear. It's imagining music. When you have a tune stuck in your head that keeps playing in the background, that's audiation at play. If you can remember a melody and sing it internally, that is audiation.

This is the cornerstone of all musical work. I can't emphasize its importance enough.

Being able to clearly audiate what you intend to play is key to perfect and [[effortless]] execution. Hearing the desired result internally and being able to sing it is how you're able to make it a reality.

# a sign of mastery over a concept
Let's say you are working on [[triads]], you have understood how they are created, you have practiced them in [[root position]] and [[inversions]] all over the [[fretboard]] in all 12 [[tonality|keys]]. This is great. 

But can you sing any triad inversion from a given note? 

If not you haven't truly mastered triads yet.

You are working on a new piece and struggle with a difficult bit. Can you clearly hear it in your mind? If not, this is where to start.

# true improvisation
A great solo is not crafted from scale shapes and arpeggio patterns. A good solo is a strong musical creation that comes from a deeper place than theoretical understanding and harmonic rules. 

A great improvised solo is first and foremost a melody that the improviser hears in their mind.
