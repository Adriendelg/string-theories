Tapping is an alternate way to produce notes on the guitar. It is an extensions of [[slurs]], [[hammer ons]] and [[pull offs]]. We use one or two hands to fret notes hard and fast enough to produce a tone. It is essentially playing the guitar like a piano with two hands on the [[fretboard]].

It was popularised by Van Halen with [Eruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4Czx8EWXb0), it allows for very fast single lines or polyphonic playing such as [Helms Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caFd7mKGRL0) by Billy McLaughlin.

It's used a lot in [[modern fingerstyle]] by players such as [[Jon Gomm]] or [[Preston Reed]]. 

This 'touch style' of playing the guitar has even inspired the creation of dedicated instruments such as the [[chapman stick]].

# how it works
Similar to a [[hammer ons|hammer on]] we hit a string fast enough, we hammer it on the fret, to produce a tone. This can be done with either the left or right hand. 

Producing a good tone is all about the speed of the finger hitting the string, it's not a matter of pressing hard. Think about Bruce Lee's one inch punch, no great movement but great speed and strength. 

# hand position
The right hand can reach over the fretboard to tap any note, it's best to put the right hand thumb down on top of the fretboard for stability. 

We can also invert the left hand position [Preston Reed style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdOLy0M8I4M) to play the bass with the left hand and the treble with the right.
