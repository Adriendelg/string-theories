*the art of getting good*

# introduction
In our digital age it has become very easy to find knowledge. This very vault is full of it. The internet is a great place to find the WHAT to practice. It is much harder to find the HOW one should learn this material and nearly impossible to explain the WHY to practice. 

How one can become great at music and playing the guitar is a question worthy of a book, it takes a lifetime to answer. 

I will try to provide my best advice and reflections on the subject. But it will be much more difficult to articulate and organise than pure knowledge such as [[music theory]] or [[technique]]. 

Most of the practice advice I will offer will take the form of a short essay more than a guitar lesson. Some of it will hopefully resonate with you, some won't. There is no perfect universal solution, we are all at different stages on our learning journeys and have different brains and learning patterns. 

I hope these reflections will give you food for thoughts, open doors for you and inspire you to try new things.
