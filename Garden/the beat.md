the second constitutive element of music, a steady beat is the foundation upon which music unfolds trough time

also called tempo, it is expressed in BPM, beats per minute
it's the marking you set on the [[metronome]]

it sets the pace of the piece and is usually indicted at the top of the sheet either as bpm or [[tempo markings]]

it should be interpreted through the [[time signature]]
