# the musical period, cadences that resolve
The most common type of cadence, the one we are most familiar with are authentic cadences. The movement from [[dominant]] to [[tonic]]. They exist in both [[major scale]] and [[minor scales]] harmony and provide a strong feeling of resolution. 

There exists variations of this [[perfect cadence]] such as resolving to Major or minor, using [[triads]] or [[tetrads]]. 
# the comma, deceptive and surprising
Some cadences do not aim at giving a strong resolution but rather plays around our expectations for it by not resolving to the [[tonic]]. They extend the tension and make a future resolution that much stronger. 
# adding style 
There are cadences with such a specific sound that they give a taste of a specific genre. The move from IV to I in a [[plagal cadence]] sounds like gospel music while I7 to IV7 screams of the blues.
