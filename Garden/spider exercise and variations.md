I call this simple warm up the spider exercises with my younger students and have kept the name as it really looks like half a spider is walking on the fretboard.

The most basic form is playing frets 1 2 3 4 on every string with fingers 1 2 3 4. 

To reduce difficulty if this is too stretchy, move up the neck to frets that are closer together. 

I would advise to pick a few permutations everyday to vary you practice.

# making it harder
There are countless variations you could come up with for this simple exercise, adding a fret between two fingers (playing frets 1345 with fingers 1234 for example), playing two notes of the pattern on a different string (the further away the harder), varying the [[articulation]] (playing it staccato or legato) etc.
