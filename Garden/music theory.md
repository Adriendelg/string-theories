*It's not rocket science. 

# [[why you need music theory]]


most of music theory can be split in three categories:
# [[pitch]]
What deals with how high or low a note is, everything related to the organisation of notes such as:
- [[scales]]
- [[melody|melodies]]
- [[chords]]
- [[harmony]]

# [[rhythm]]
All that relates to the unfolding of music in time. All that deals with [[the beat]] and its division and subdivisions.

# [[form]]
How we organise different musical elements into a coherent whole, the architecture of a piece of music. Is it a [[sonata]]? a [[song form]]? a [[blues]]?
