*There are only a few things as frustrating as having a note that refuses to come out. 

The most common issues I have encountered are [[muted notes]] and [[buzzing]] which both come from fretting the note at the wrong place. They can easily be fixed by [[simple principles for a great left hand]].

Another mistake I see quite often is [[flag poling]] or [[tucking]] of fingers when they should keep their natural relaxed curvature.
