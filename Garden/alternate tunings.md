# What are alternate tunings ?
Alternate tunings are simply another way to tune the guitar strings than standard tuning. 

There are a near infinite number of tunings available, we have the chance to play an instrument that allows the easy modification of its tuning why not explore it ? Think about a piano or a saxophone, there's no way to alter its range or change the layout of the notes without rebuilding half the instrument. 

You can find open tunings in a variety of guitar styles, folk, math rock, fingerstyle, traditional music or even metal. 

Some people have dedicated most of their work to one tuning such as Pierre Bensusan with DADGAD or Robert Fripp with his 5th tuning (NST) while some others use a different tuning every song .


> [!NOTE] Nomenclature
> I have chosen to use the terms alternate tunings for any tuning that is not standard and open tuning for any tuning that spells a triad such as "open D".
