*theory is a language*

Guitar players have a weird relationship to music theory, you just have to read some posts on reddit or the comments on a youtube video to realise how divisive the subject is to the guitar community. 

I am here to argue for the importance of knowing at least the basics of music theory. 

# theory is naming musical elements
That's all it is, a naming convention agreed on by the majority. A major triad exists wether it has a name or not. In order to communicate to someone else what the chord is you could show a shape on guitar, name the pitches, play the notes in the hopes the other person gets the message. Or you could simply give it its proper name. Music theory is about making the communication of musical information through language as efficient as possible. 

Would you rather describe a chair as "that thing with four legs that you sit on" or simply as a chair?

Just like any language, after mastering it you start thinking in it. Knowing theory allows you to manipulate concepts more easily. Instead of trial and error to find your next chord you could just use some theory knowledge and already have a few options in mind. You could think in keys, in time signatures, in forms identify elements simply by listening to them or reading them. 

Language is a tool, it is a mean to an end: communicating and manipulating ideas with clarity. Learning a language is adding a tool to your toolbox, it doesn't remove anything of your previous abilities. Because you learn a second language doesn't make you lose the ability to understand your mother tongue. Because you know what an adverb and an adjective are doesn't prevent you from forming sentences effortlessly. 

# some amazing musicians never knew any theory
Yes, there are a number of amazing musicians that never knew any formal musical theory. They produced a great body of work that compares favorably in quality to the work produced by more educated musicians. This is undeniable. However, would some theory knowledge have negatively impacted their musical output? I don't think so. On the contrary I believe it would not have robbed them from their previous abilities such as a very good ear or great creativity but would have given them more tools to work with. 

Most accomplished musicians that know very little theory have to work really hard at creating a workflow and communication system to collaborate with other musicians. If you don't read and write how can you work on an arrangement with other people? how can you give clear indications? I am not saying there are no other way than established language to communicate ideas, I am arguing that using the agreed-upon nomenclature is always the fastest and easiest solution. 
Unless you are on some sort of [[Allan Holdsworth]] level of genius and have enough time and energy to create your own system of understanding music just be lazy, don't reinvent the wheel. Use the one that works and has worked for centuries. 

# you need a system
If you are serious about music, if you want to compose great work, study the great works of others or form productive relationships with other musicians then you need a system of understanding music that you can reliably use. 

Dealing with [[the 12 semitones|12 semitones]], [[rhythm]] and [[structure, form|form]] is hard work, not using the hard work of others that came before you is not only foolish but probably counter productive to your musical goals. Stand on the shoulders of giants. 

Being able to look at dots on a staff and hear it in your mind is a superpower, being able to listen to a tune a few times and draft a chart is a superpower, being able to take apart a sonata is a superpower. Study [[music theory]], become a super hero. 

# theory alone is not enough
Knowing all the scales, all the arpeggios, being able to analyse a lead sheet are all useful but applying it on the instrument is even more useful. Unless you plan on being a musical scholar of some kind, theoretical knowledge is not enough. You need to apply it to your instrument, master it physically just as much as you master it mentally. You don't only need music theory but applied music theory. 

Turn [[knowledge into know-how]].
