# the nomenclature
We use numbers to indicate left hand fingers, this can be confusing at first for piano players where they use 1 for the thumb.

# the art of left hand fingerings 
due to [[note repetition on the fretboard]] there are often multiple ways to play a given musical element wether it's scales, chords, arpeggios

choosing the right left hand fingering considering:
- phrasing
- ease of play
- interaction with right hand
- where you are on the fretboard
- where you are going
- how tired your hand is
is a challenge, it's all about making compromise and sacrifice, rarely will you consistently find a fingering that ticks all the right boxes

though I believe there is a method to the madness
