chord progressions are formulas, they are mini recipes to create all kinds of dishes

I differentiate chords progressions from [[cadence|cadences]] in two ways. Cadences refer to short, 2 or 3 chords fragments that perform a punctuating role in the musical discourse while progressions are longer. A chord progression can contain a number of cadences. If cadences are the turning points in a story, progressions are the general arc with a beginning, middle and end. 

Just like there are typical stories which follow a general schema, there are some very common chord progressions. 

It would be impossible to list all possible chord progressions, I will mention only the most common, ones found in many songs and pieces.
