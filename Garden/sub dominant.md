If the [[tonic]] is home, the sub dominant is leaving home.  It is not yet a strong tension asking to be resolved but is certainly a departure from home. 

In the [[major scale harmonisation in triads]] three chords qualify as sub dominant:
- ii
- IV
- vii

Note that the [[functions|function]] of a chord has nothing to do with its [[triads|nature]], a sub dominant can be a Major, minor or diminished chord. 

The sub dominant plays the role of preparing tension.
