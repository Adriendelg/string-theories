When dealing with [[chords]] on the [[fretboard]], we use chord diagrams to indicate how they are played. They are a great visual aid that is much faster to read than [[[reading tablatures|tabs]] or [[the staff|standard notation]].

Here is an example for a C Major chord:

# how it works and variations
Chord diagram show part of the [[fretboard]], strings are ordered from the lowest to the highest as if you were looking at a guitar neck from the front. 

Dots show where you should fret notes, they sometimes feature additional information such as the [[fingerings]], what note is played or what [[intervals|interval]] it is relative to the root. I will try to always highlight the root of the chord in red but this is not a standard. 

We use 0 and X to show either an open string or a string that is not played, these are very important. Not respecting an X can totally change the nature of a chord.

To show where the chord is played on the neck we will use numbers or roman numerals on the side to indicate which fret the diagram shows.
