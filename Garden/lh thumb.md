the left hand thumb is too often forgotten

its role is way more important than one might first think, it provides stability and strength to the [[left hand]]

it is ideally positioned opposite the middle finger, it should not be static and can change position to accommodate different technical needs

it plays a huge role in all [[fretting]] and [[barre chords]]

depending on the style of guitar, instrument played or technique at hand there are two main ways to position the thumb
[[lh thumb over or behind the neck]]
