My goal with this ressource is to provide documentation of my understanding of concepts on guitar playing, music theory, practicing. As much as it can help you grasp ideas quickly, it can not replace you physically experiencing any of these concepts. There is a big difference between understanding how something works and knowing how to do it yourself [[effortless|effortlessly]]. 

You could have understood all there is to know about doing a pull up, the correct posture, technique, the anatomy behind the movement and yet not be able to perform one. 

You could be know all there is to know about blue cheese, how it is made, the type of bacteria and mold involved in its creation, its history, the different types, the best wine pairing etc. but you don't truly know it until you've tasted its beautiful disgustingness. 

Music can be, in part, an intellectual experience. Understanding how it works is fascinating and rewarding. But it does not equate to being a good player. Being a scholar and being a performer are two very different things indeed. 

Your job as a learner is to digest concepts slowly until they become a part of your playing you do not have to think about anymore. 

In order to develop a thorough knowledge and know-how, it is important to always apply concepts you learn until they become second nature. 

This is the art of [[practice]].
