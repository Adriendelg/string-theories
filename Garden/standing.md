The first thing to address regarding playing standing up, besides a healthy standing posture, is the length of your [[strap]]. If the guitar sits too low, you will end up creating a weird angle with your left wrist. I know playing with the guitar very low looks cool but it's really not a healthy habit. You don't want it to high either as playing fingerstyle we need to move our hands around all the time. 

It should sit at a height where both your arms are relaxed and your shoulders free of tension. 

Ideally you shouldn't have too much neck dive but this only depends on your instrument. If you have a little, resting your right arm on the body should be enough to compensate it without having to exert any force. 

Now remember your standing posture, feet shoulder width apart, knees unlocked, back straight, head aligned. 

The angle at which the guitar rests compared to your body is also important, you want to simply lift your left hand bending the elbow and the neck should fall right into your hand. Play with the angle of the guitar until it does.
