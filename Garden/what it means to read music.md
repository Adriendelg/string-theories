There are multiple layers to reading music, seeing a note on a [[the staff|staff]], identifying it and playing it on the guitar requires multiple levels of understanding.

# identifying the note
One aspect of reading music is the ability to name a pitch when you see it on the staff. This starts slow and painful, counting lines and spaces. With training one is able to identify notes on the fly and read them like words.

# [[sight singing]]
Knowing a note name from reading is not all there is to reading music. An experienced reader not only identifies the name of every pitch they see but also hear it internally. They [[audiation|audiate]] the melody in their mind and can sing it out loud. This makes use of [[relative pitch]] or [[perfect pitch]]. This ability requires serious [[ear training]] but pays very high dividends. 

I had a teacher saying that we don't play what we read but play what we hear when reading. Meaning a way to get better at [[sight reading]] is to get better at a combination of reading and [[ear training]].

# [[sight reading]]
Sight reading refers to the ability to play a piece of music you have never seen from reading the sheet. For most guitar players this is very difficult. It requires great reading skills as well as good knowledge of the [[fretboard]].
