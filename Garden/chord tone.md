Chord tone means a note that belongs to a chord. For example in a CMaj7 chord C, E, G and B would be considered chord tones. 

This notion is particularly useful when learning [[jazz improvisation]] and [[improvisation]] in general where in order to make a strong musical phrase one tries to aim for chord tones. 

When we deal with [[tension and release]], resolving a dissonance to a chord tone is one way to give a strong release feeling.
