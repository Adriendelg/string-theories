Accidentals are signs we use to modify the pitch of a note, it's the name we use for the black keys on the keyboard. There are five signs we commonly use:

1. Sharp ♯, it raises a note by a [[the 12 semitones|semitone]]. Meaning the next fret, for example F# is a half step higher than F.
2. Flat ♭, lowers a note by a semitone. Meaning the previous fret, for example D♭ is a half step lower than D.
3. Natural ♮, cancels any previous flat or sharp. It returns the note to its original pitch. Example if C# is used in the [[key signature]] and C♮ is used in a bar it means play a "normal" C.

There also exist double flats 𝄫 and double sharps 𝄪 lowering or raising a note by a full step, they are theoretically useful in some scenarios but quite rare. 

Following the logic of sharps and flats, every accidental could be named two ways, this is called [[enharmonics]].
