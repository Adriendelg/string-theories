The bridge plays a key role in creating a sound of of the guitar. When we set [[strings in motion]], their vibration is transmitted to the [[sound board]] thanks to the bridge.

There are slight differences between [[classical|classical guitar]] and [[acoustic|acoustic guitar]] bridges but their role is similar. 

# classical guitar bridges
On classical most classical guitars the bridge will look exactly the same. There is a tradition to respect. It features a hole through which we loop and tie the strings [[changing classical guitar strings|in a specific way]].

# acoustic guitar bridges
There are two main types of bridges found on acoustic guitar (three if we count [[archtop]] with a tail piece). 

## pin bridge
This is the typical bridge on most acoustic guitars, it's how the traditional [[Martin guitars]] are made. There are holes and pins for every string. This solution can be finicky at times and bridge pins wear out with time and need replacement. They can also sometimes break and are in my opinion a general pain in the ass.

## pinless bridge
Some modern builders have started making pinless bridges, where the strings go through and lock thanks to the ball end. This is how both my handmade acoustic guitars are made. I highly prefer this solution which is not only way more durable but makes string changing much easier.
