# what are picks
Picks come in a variety of shapes, materials and thickness. They are an integral part of many guitar playing techniques and traditions. From funky strumming to shredding scales, the pick is a useful tool for when the [[fingers]] are not doing the job.

# different kinds of picks
There's a big difference in tone and feel between a thin and flexible pick one would use for [[strumming]] an acoustic guitar and the more rigid and pointy one shredders like for [[single note picking]], gipsy players like really thick and strong picks, some like pointed tips some like rounder tips. It is all a matter of taste, technique and about the tone you desire to achieve.
