I derive the idea of use from the [[Alexander technique]], a school of posture, movement and everyday ergonomics. 

The term refers to the use of the self. Here self means the individual in its entirety, body and mind as one, the whole system. 

How you use this self is the psycho-physical, the mental and physical you inhabit and how you move through it. 

How you navigate the physical and mental world with this vehicle of meat and thoughts.z
