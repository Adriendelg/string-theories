> [!NOTE] my tuning of choice
> I play all improvised music in P4 tuning, it has helped me learn jazz and makes more sense to my brain than having to compute a third in an otherwise 4th oriented matrix.
> I use it as my reference point, this is where I know all my chords, scales, arpeggios, language etc. It serves the purpose of a keyboard in my [[composition]] process

# spelling
E A D G C F 

# why
fixes one issue with learning the guitar which is the [[multiplicity of fingerings across string sets]], using all 4ths means shapes are not only transposable horizontally but also vertically. this reduces the amount of shapes to learn for given material

offers C and F as open strings which is helpful when playing [[jazz]] as many tunes written by horn players revolve around the flat side of the [[tonality#circle of fifths|circle of fifths]] where E and B would be of no use

consistent tuning allows for easier link between ears and fingers

# downsides
it makes easy things hard and hard things easy
for example, no more easy open chords or 6 strings [[barre chords]]
