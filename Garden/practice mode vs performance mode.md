*there is a time for thinking and a time for acting*

Getting better at a task requires repetition and feedback. We plan, play, listen, analyse and try to address what didn't go as planned before starting again.

This is the basic [[feedback loop]] in which we are engaged when learning an instrument.

Practice without any form of feedback is not only useless but can also be detrimental, if you keep repeating a mistake it will soon become automatic. 

This is why we need teachers, mentors or at least an attentive ear. We need someone of something to tell us that we are going in the right direction or not. While regular lessons are the best way to check in and measure our progress, we can't have a teacher watching our every practice session.

We need to develop our own ability to measure if our playing is going in the right direction, a kind of active listening helping us make the necessary adjustments. This is in part developed though your interactions with good teachers or good teaching material, you learn to listen for the right details. You become your own teacher, always watching, analysing and addressing what needs work. 

We all create this internal voice, this teacher inside of us advising us along the way. Just like any self talk, this voice can be a great help or a nemesis, it can support you to grow or make your life a living hell. 

# a tale of facial expressions
I remember a classical guitar workshop I attended during my Bachelor's. A good friend of mine was performing on stage, I had heard him practice the piece for a while and knew he could play it well. Maybe it was the nerves of performing in front of other people or playing for a new famous teacher but his playing wasn't as good as I knew it could be. He knew it too. 

As he was playing, I could see him making faces as he approached difficult runs, I watched his expression change every time he made a slight mistake. You could guess his internal dialogue from his facial expressions, you could watch him think in real time and critique his own playing. 

From the audience perspective, this only made the mistakes more obvious. It also created a palpable tension, we could empathetically feel how he was struggling. This was the opposite of [[effortless]], it was painful.

This is only one example of something I have witnessed countless times in my musical education. Someone being stuck in what I call "practice mode" when he should really have been in "performance mode".

# the two modes
First let me define what I mean by practice and performance mode. As musicians there are two distinct things we do: we practice or we perform. They are very different activities, what happens in the practice room and what happens on stage couldn't be more different. 

Practicing is conscious repetition, analysis, refinement, more repetition, pen and paper, sweat, rewriting fingerings, more repetition, self loathing, active listening, experimentations, exercises, metronome, more repetition, doubt, improvement, making choices, evaluating, changing interpretations... practicing is about playing with your brain turned on, with all your attention pointed toward improving your playing. It means listening to your internal teacher, thinking, iterating, evaluating and improving. 

The practice room is where you make a disgusted faces as you fail to perform a scale, it's where shout out loud when you finally nail it. It's where you doubt yourself, it's where you actively judge your playing. 

Performing on the other hand should be the complete opposite. When on stage, there is no space for thoughts, for internal dialogue. Playing should be effortless, it should [[flow]]. No conscious thought is necessary, only pure surrendering to the music. 

The stage is where the ego disappears and only the music remains.

> Practice mode is internal dialogue on, inner critique encouraged, progress oriented.
> Performance mode is fully in the moment, no mental chatter.

# mistaking one for the other
## playing instead of practicing
Along my long musical studies I have encountered a funny phenomenon, a kind of dick measuring contest revolving around practice time. It wasn't uncommon in the conservatoire to hear someone boasting about having practiced for 8 hours on a given day. We still read interviews of artists saying they practiced for X hours everyday when they were young. 

First I would like to doubt the number, when going through music college I can't really imagine anyone having that many free hours to practice. Unless they did not sleep, eat or have a social life (which is the point of college). 

Second I highly doubt all these hours could really be called practicing. Sure they might have spent a great deal of time with the instrument in their hands, playing. But was it truly practicing?

Practice is deliberate, it has an intent, it requires a great deal of concentration. Real practice asks to be fully focused on a simple repetitive task, when done right is should be exhausting. Just the same way you can't expect a muscle to grow without strain and fatigue, you can't expect yourself to make progress without real tiring effort. 

You could spend hours in the practice room playing to your heart content without making much progress. You were not really in focused practice mode, just having fun with your instrument. There is nothing wrong with having fun, only one should always be honest about how they really spent their time.
