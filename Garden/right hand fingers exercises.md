Developing an efficient open right hand technique can mean a lot of things, the right hand can perform a number of very different movements that all deserve special attention and specific exercises. 

We should start by focusing on the simplest plucking motion with an emphasis on creating a good tone and good fine motor skills.

# simplest free stroke and rest stroke exercise
The first exercise any kid learns when starting classical guitar is alternating i and m (see [[right hand fingerings]]) [[free strokes]] on every string. This simple walking motion is at the basis of a lot more advanced movements.

Start by playing every string twice, alternating index and middle while keeping a relaxed position and a regular tempo. 

There are plenty of variations of this exercise to increase or vary the difficulty such as: 
- play each string 3 times thus changing which finger starts the movement
- vary speed
- use another pair of fingers (ia, ma)
- skip strings
- use [[rest strokes]]
- change finger pair on every string

> [!NOTE] Simple but essential
> Even though these exercise look and sound really simple, I still use them on a daily basis as [[warm up]] and to stay in good playing shape when I don't have much time. Don't neglect basic exercises, they are the most important as they help you connect with the instrument.


> [!hint] Similarity with the pick
> These alternating exercises for fingers have twin pick exercises revolving around up and down picking.
