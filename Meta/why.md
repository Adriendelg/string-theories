My area of expertise is music, especially really nerdy guitar music. I have spent my entire life learning everything I can get my hands on about the guitar, about learning it, playing it, building it, teaching it. There is this running joke in my family that my first three words were mom, dad and guitar. I can't testify to the truth of this story, you'd have to ask my mom. What started as a childhood fascination turned into an adolescent obsession and later into a passion and a career. This digital place is my way of giving back to the world all that I have learned about guitar playing. 

Along my studies I discovered Obsidian and the field of knowledge management. I believe this medium is particularly suited to sharing a body of knowledge in a more natural way than any textbook or video course. With this project, I want to offer a digital space one can get lost in. I want to create the resource I would have loved to find when I was a teenager hungry for knowledge. 

Not only do I want to create a digital repository of all of my guitar knowledge I also wish to offer a more intimate experience than traditional resources. The knowledge expressed here will always be my own, acquired through experience and research. I have no other aspiration than offering my honest and informed opinion on subjects I have knowledge about. Please feel free to disagree, and if you feel like you have an interesting and more pertinent take on the subject please reach out. I desire nothing more than to learn more and nuance my understanding. I will never write anything about topics I do not have an informed and solid opinion about. This work does not aim at becoming a comprehensive encyclopedia of guitar playing, simply the digital expression of a life lived in the company of music and a lot of guitars. 

 Beginner or advanced, I believe there is always something to get from picking the brain of another player. Feel free to wonder through my digital one.
