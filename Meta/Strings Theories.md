Welcome. 

This will be a growing digital garden of my [[guitar]], [[music theory]] and [[practice]] knowledge. 

# what this thing is
This is an [[obsidian]] vault, a growing collection of linked notes. It is a an evolving digital space where I store bits of knowledge and organise them. It is akin to a garden growing under supervision.  I write, rewrite, edit, link, develop, cut, and prune notes daily. Nothing is static, it’s alive. It is human, far from perfect and will always be. 

It is organised through links and minimal tags, it is made to mirror how I think about concepts and their relations.

It contains my best explanations and advice, the knowledge I gathered playing the guitar and studying it.

It contains short, concise notes, lessons, didactic material, short essays, longer essays, examples, stories, articles, resources and any format that I feel is relevant to understanding an idea.

It is my informed opinion on subjects I am genuinely interested in and therefore is full of human flaws and biases. I will try to always remain nuanced and entertain multiple viewpoints before synthesis.

It will only be about topics I feel knowledgeable about, it is a reflection of my actual skills and understanding. Some areas will be very nerdy, documented and specific while some will remain more surface level. This is the natural state of one's knowledge, I will try not to reach out of my domain of expertise.

This project is an attempt at creating a lasting digital legacy of my life spent with the instrument. As such it has no end, it will already take years for it to catch up to my actual knowledge and will keep growing as I learn.

It is a resource for students of the guitar, it is the kind of place I would have loved to find as a teenager. I hope it becomes a place where one can get lost following a trail, a place where exploration leads to discovery.

I aim at starting this collection of ideas at the very basics, to start with fundamentals and make them as robust as possible.  I try to operate from first principles and define every element and concept I mention. 


# what it isn’t 
It is not a book. It is not a course. It is not a blog. It is not always right. It is not an exhaustive encyclopedia of the guitar and does not aim to be. It is not polished and final and will never be.
