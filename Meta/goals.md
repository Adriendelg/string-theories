Engaging in public learning and offering free knowledge. Creating a useful and lasting resource. 

# what I get from it
clarifying ideas, formulating concepts, explaining things I have mastered for a while forces me to think of the simplest way to communicate it to someone else

it's a huge part of being a teacher

I get a deeper and clearer understanding of concepts by having to lay them down with words

as I have been playing for as long as I can remember, this leads me to make conscious a lot of things I take for granted
